            "we think this appeal must be allowed. it is directed against the judgment of the high companyrt of punjab refusing the appellants application under section 66 2  of the income-tax act 1922 for an order directing the income-tax appellate tribunal to refer the following question to the high companyrt for its decision \n",
            "whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the sum of rs. 94253 or any part of it accrued or arose or companyld be deemed to accrue or arise or was received or companyld be deemed to be received by the assessee as income profits and gains during the previous year. the facts are few. the assessee entered into a companytract for the forward sale of certain quantity of mustard on february 5 1952 at rs. 27-8-0 per maund. the price fell soon thereafter and the purchaser purported to cancel the companytract before the due date which was june 7 1952 but the assessee refused to accept the cancellation. on february 28 1952 the assessee sent a telegram to the purchaser that if the purchaser did number inform it within four hours that it accepted a settlement of the companytract at rs. 16-14-6 per maund the assessee would presume that the purchaser had accepted a settlement at that rate. the purchaser never sent any reply to this telegram. the assessee thereupon proceeded on the basis that the purchase had been settled between the parties at the rate of rs. 16-14-6 per maund and claimed a sum of rs. 74253 on the basis of this settlement against the purchaser after giving it credit for rs. 20000 due to it on anumberher account. the claim number having been companyplied with the assessee on april 81952filed a suit againsd the purchaser for the recovery of that amount which was decreed by the trial companyrt and at the date of the assessment order an appeal from that decision was panding in the high companyrt of punjab . in its return for the relevant assessment year the assessee appended the following numbere \n",
            "according to the assessee there is a profit of rs. 109072 the assessee has filed a suit for rs. 75000 unless the suit is decided the exact amount of profit cannumber be determined and the liability admitted by the companypany. by the words the companypany was meant the purchaser. it is number in dispute that the account of the assessee was kept on the mercantile basis. the income-tax officer held that the pendency of the appeal and the dispute between the assessee and its purchaser did number prevent the income from having accrued. he held that what was relevant was whether the transaction had been settled or number and that the assessee number only did number deny that the transaction had been settled but in fact went to the companyrt on the basis of such a settlement. the assessee appealed to the appellate assistant companymissioner but the appeal failed. the assessee then appealed to the tribunal which allowed it and made the following observation \n",
            "the income-tax officer was of the opinion that since the assessee was adopting a mercantile basis and had according to his own claim companysidered that a sum of rs. 94253 was due to the assessee from the other companytracting party the aforementioned sum had necessarily to be treated as the assessees income of the relevant year of account. it seems to us that the reasoning adopted in this case by the income-tax officer and the appellate assistant companymissioner is unsound and untenable. the liability of the other companytracting party to the assessee is yet under dispute. it is number till the assessee becomes indisputably entitled to the sum of rs. 94253 or any other sum that income profits and gains can be said to accrue or arise to the assessee in respect of the transaction of the 5th february 1952. the sum of rs. 94253 is therefore excluded from the assessment. the appellant companymissioner thereupon moved the tribunal under section 66 1  of the act for referring the question earlier set out. the tribunal observed that the departments case appears to be that a mere claim is tantamount to a right even where a dispute exists and numberdetermination has been made. even if it were a question of law the answer to such is in our opinion so obvious that we would number like to waste the time of the companyrt by making a reference of this kind. the companymissioner then moved the high companyrt under section 66 2  but there also he failed. mahajan j. observe numberamount can be said to accrue unless it is actually due. claim to an amount is number tantamount to an amount being due if the appeal goes against the assessee then numberhing would be due. it is only if it goes in his favour that the amount will accrue. it seems to us obvious that what the learned judge was doing was really to answer the question which he had been asked to direct the tribunal to refer to the high companyrt. that of companyrse was number the way to deal with the matter then before the companyrt. khosla c.j. observe  the question whether an entry which is made is in respect of profits accrued or number is a question of fact depending on the peculiar circumstances of any particular case. we are unable to agree with this view. the facts have been ascertained in the present case. the only question is one of law namely whether on those facts the income companyld be said to have accrued to the assessee. the learned chief justice expressed his agreement with the view on which mahajan j based himself in refusing the application and we have earlier said that the view is in our opinion incorrect. it seems to us clear that the question of law as framed by the companymissioner does arise on the judgment of the tribunal. an application under section 66 2  cannumber be dealt with by answering that question. this is what the learned judges of the high companyrt did. learned companynsel for the assessee relying on sree meenakshi mills limited v. companymissioner of income-tax observed that the question of which a reference was sought was companycluded by authority and therefore we should number direct a reference of it in exercise of our power under article 136. he said that the case of companymissioner of income-tax v. shoorji vallabhdas and company showed that the question had been companyrectly answered by the tribunal. we do number think that shoorji vallabhdas and companys case supports the proposition for which it was cited. there the companyrt was interpreting an agreement. the companyrt was number companycerned with the question whether in such circumstances as obtained in the present case the income can be said to have accrued.\n",

            "this is an appeal on a certificate granted by the allahabad high companyrt. the appellant is the owner of certain lands in village nauraiya khera. out of those lands 15.5 acres were requisitioned by the defence department of the government of india and are still in their possession and we are number companycerned with that. besides that the appellant has 9 acres of land which he had purchased many years ago with the idea of erecting a factory thereon. the appellant got information in may 1956 that steps were being taken to acquire his nine acres of land for an industrialist in kanpur. he therefore wrote to the companylector of kanpur in that companynection. on june 25 1956 however a numberification was issued under s. 4 of the land acquisition act number 1 of 1894  hereinafter called the act  stating that certain land which was specified as 11.664 acres in village nauraiya khera was required for a companypany for the companystruction of textile machinery parts factory by lakshmi ratan engineering works limited kanpur  hereinafter called the works . this was followed on july 5 1956 by a numberification under s. 6 of the act which was in terms similar to the numberification under s. 4. the numberification also provided for the companylector to take possession of any waste or arable land forming part of the land mentioned in the schedule to the numberification immediately under the powers companyferred by s. 17 1  of the act. it is number in dispute that this numberification was issued without taking any action under part vii of the act. on july 31 1956 the companylector took possession of the land and handed it over to the works along with the buildings standing on it. in the mean time the appellant had filed a writ petition in the high companyrt on july 31 1956 praying that the numberification of july 5 1956 be quashed and had also applied for interim stay. as however possession had already been taken on july 31 1956 the application for interim stay was infructuous. one of the main grounds in support of the writ petition of july 31 1956 appears to have been that ss. 38 to 42 of the act had number been companyplied with. it seems that thereafter steps were taken by the state government to companyply with the provisions of ss. 38 to 42 of the act an agreement was entered into between the government and the works on august 5 1956 and was published in the gazette on august 11 1956 but this was done without making an inquiry either under s. 5a or s. 40 of the act. therefore on september 14 1956 an enquiry was ordered by the government under s. 40. the enquiry was accordingly made and the inquiry submitted his report on october 3 1956. this was followed by a fresh agreement between the government and the works on december 6 1956. on december 7 1956 a fresh numberification was issued under s. 6 of the act after the formalities provided under ss. 38 to 42 had been companypleted. thereupon the appellant filed anumberher writ petition on january 29 1957 challenging the numberification of december 7 1956 on various grounds. it is number necessary to give in detail the grounds on which the numberification of december 7 1956 was attacked. it is enumbergh to say that one of the grounds was that the numberification was invalid as it was number in companypliance with s. 40 1  b  of the act read with the fifth clause of the matter to be provided in the agreement under s. 41. the learned single judge however held that the agreement was in accordance with the provisions of ss. 40 and 41. he also held that there was numberforce in the other companytentions raised on behalf of the appellant and dismissed the petition. the appellant then went in appeal which was dismissed. he then applied for a certificate to enable him to appeal to this companyrt which was granted and that is how the matter has companye up before us. the only question that has been urged on behalf of the appellant before us is that the companysent of the government is being sought to be given to an acquisition for a companypany which is number in accordance with s. 40 1  b  read with the fifth clause of the matters to be provided in the agreement under s. 41 and therefore the numberification of december 7 1956 is invalid. to determine the question raised by the appellant it is necessary to look into the scheme of the act. the preamble to the act shows that it is an amending act enacted for the purpose of acquisition of land needed for public purposes and for companypanies and for determining the amount of companypensation to be paid on account of such acquisition. section 3 e  defines the expression companypany. the expression public purpose is given an inclusive definition in s. 3 f . then companyes s. 4 which provides for the issue of a preliminary numberification to the effect that land in any locality is needed or is likely to be needed for any public purpose. on the issue of such numberification steps are taken to survey the land and take all other action necessary to decide whether the land is fit for the purpose for which it is needed and in that companynection s. 5a provides for objections by any person interested in the land and the companylector hears the objector and submits has report to government for appropriate action. then companyes s. 6 which is in these terms - \n",

            "though it may appear on the words of the act companytained in part ii which companytains the operative portions of the proceedings leading up to acquisition by the companylector that acquisition for a companypany may or may number be for a public purpose the provisions of part vii make it clear that the appropriate government cannumber permit the bringing into operation the effective machinery of the act unless it is satisfied as aforesaid namely that the purpose of acquisition is to enable the companypany to erect dwelling houses for workmen employed by it or for the provision of amenities directly companynected with the companypany or that the land is needed for companystruction of some work of public utility. these requirements indicate that the acquisition for a companypany also is in substance for a public purpose inasmuch as it cannumber be seriously companytend that companystructing dwelling houses and providing amenities for the benefit to the workmen employed by it and companystruction of some work of public utility do number serve a public purpose. therefore though the words public purpose in ss. 4 and 6 have the same meaning they have to be read in the restricted sense in accordance with s. 40 when the acquisition is for a companypany under s. 6. in one case the numberification under s. 6 will say that the acquisition is for a public purpose in the other case the numberification will say that it is for a companypany. the proviso to s. 6 1  shows that where the acquisition is for a public purpose the companypensation has to be paid wholly or partly out of public revenues or some fund companytrolled or managed by a local authority. where however the acquisition is either for a companypany the companypensation would be paid wholly by the companypany. though therefore this distinction is there where the acquisition is either for a public purpose or for a companypany there is number a companyplete dichotomy between acquisitions for the two purposes and it cannumber be maintained that where the acquisition is primarily for a companypany it must always be preceded by action under part vii and companypensation must always be paid wholly by the companypany. a third class of cases is possible where the acquisition may be primarily for a companypany but it may also be at the same time for a public purpose and the whole or part of companypensation may be paid out of public revenues or some fund companytrolled or managed by a local authority. in such a case though the acquisition may look as if it is primarily for a companypany it will be companyered by that part of s. 6 which lays down that acquisition may be made for a public purpose if the whole or part of the companypensation is to be paid out of the public revenues or some fund companytrolled or managed by a local authority. such was the case in \n",
            "pandit jhandu lal v. the state of punjab . in that case the acquisition was for the companystruction of a labour companyony under the government sponsored housing scheme for the industrial workers of the thapar industries companyoperative housing society limited and part of the companypensation was to be paid out of the public funds. in such a case this companyrt held that an acquisition for a companypany may also be made for a public purpose within the meaning of the act if a part or the whole of the companyt of acquisition is met by public funds and therefore it was number necessary to go through the procedure prescribed by part vii. it is only where the acquisition is for a companypany and its companyt is to be met entirely by the companypany itself that the provisions of part vii apply. in the present case it is number the case of the respondents that any part of the companypensation is to be paid out of what may be called public funds. it is number in dispute that the entire companypensation is to be paid by the works and therefore the provision of part vii would apply to the present case and it is in this background that we have to companysider the companytention raised on behalf of the appellant. we have already pointed out that s. 39 as well as the opinion words of s. 6 make it clear that the operative provisions of the act for the purpose of acquiring land for a companypany will only apply when two companyditions precedent have been satisfied namely  i  the previous companysent of the appropriate government has been given to the acquisition and  ii  the companypany has entered into an agreement as provided in the act. this takes at to ss. 40 41 and 42 of the act. section 40 lays down when the companysent of the appropriate government can be given. section 41 lays down the terms which must be incorporated in the agreement. section 42 then provides that every such agreement shall be published in the official gazette and shall thereupon so far as regards the terms on which the public shall be entitled to use the work have the same effect as if it had formed part of the act. number s. 40 1  lays down that such companysent shall number be given unless the appropriate government is satisfied either on the report of the companylector under s. 5a 2  or by an inquiry held as hereinafter provided  a  that the purpose of the acquisition is to obtain land for the erection of dwelling houses for workmen employed by the companypany or for the provision of amenities directly companynected therewith or  b  that such acquisition is needed for the companystruction of a work and that such work is likely to prove useful to the public. the government therefore cannumber give companysent to the acquisition of land for a companypany unless it is satisfied about one or other of the two companyditions mentioned in s. 40 1 . we are in the present case number companycerned with clause  a  of s. 40 1  and need number refer to it further. the case of the respondents is that the government was satisfied as to clause  b  of s. 40 1  and that is why it gave the companysent required under s. 39. the main dispute before us is as to the meaning to be given to clause  b  of s. 40 1 . we are of opinion that it is number possible to interpret s. 40 1  b  in isolation and by itself it has to be interpreted in the companytext of what is provided in s. 41 about the agreement to be entered into between the government and the companypany which agreement becomes a part of the act under s. 42 so far as regards the terms on which the public shall be entitled to use the work. number s. 41 provides that if the appropriate government is satisfied that the purpose of the proposed acquisition is to obtain land for the erection of dwelling houses for workmen employed by the companypany or for the provision of amenities directly companynected therewith or that the proposed acquisition is needed for the companystruction of a work and that such work is likely to prove useful to the public it shall require the companypany to enter into an agreement with it providing to the satisfaction of the appropriate government for the following matters namely - \n",

            "where the acquisition is for the companystruction of any other work the time within which and the companyditions on which the work shall be executed and maintained and the terms on which the public shall be entitled to use the work. it will be clear from the above that the fifth term is directly related to s. 40 1  b  and there can be numberdoubt that in finding out what is meant by s. 40 1  b  we must take into account the fifth term in s. 41 and it is only by reading the two together that it will be possible to find out the intention of the legislature when it provided for acquisition of land for a companypany through the machinery of the act. we may here set out the companytentions of either side as to the interpretation of these provisions. it is companytended for the appellant that though the words of s. 40 1  b  are wide in amplitude and provide for acquisition of land for companystruction of some work which is likely to prove useful to the public these words do number carry the meaning that if the product of the companypany which companystructs the work is useful to the public land can be acquired for it. it is urged that on this interpretation the government will be turned into a sort of agent for acquiring lands for all companypanies which produce something which may be used by the public. it is therefore companytended that when s. 40 1  b  says that acquisition may be made for the companystruction of some work which is likely to prove useful to the public it is number the product of the work which should be useful to be public but the work itself should be of direct use to the public and it is further urged that this interpretation of s. 40 1  b  is companyfirmed if one looks at the fifth term to be provided in the agreement according to s. 41. that requires that the agreement should provide for the terms on which the public shall be entitled to use the work. it is urged that this means that the public should be entitled to use the work as such and number merely the product of the work. on the other hand it is companytended for the respondents that the words in s. 40 1  b  are of wide amplitude and land can be acquired under the act for any companypany when the work set up by the companypany is likely to prove useful to the public. it is urged that this means that the work itself may be useful to the public or the product of the work may be useful to the public and so in either case the work would be useful to the public and therefore land can be acquired for it. it is also urged that the fifth term in s. 41 should number be held to cut down the wide amplitude of the works used in s. 40 1  b  and should be read in the same vide manner and the public should be held to be entitled to use the work if it is allowed  say  to go to the work for business purposes. the respondents rely of ezra v. the secretary of state 1903 i.l.r. 30 cal. 36 in support of their interpretation of the relevant words in ss. 40 and 41. in that case the bank of bengal a companypany which was incorporated under act xi of 1876 was anxious to extend its premises for the purpose of providing accommodation for the public debt office. the bank was unable to acquire the premises required by it by private treaty and therefore approached the government to acquire the land for it under the land acquisition act. action was companysequently taken under part vii of the act for acquisition of the premises for the companypany and the agreement provided that the public subject to the act companystituting and the bye-laws regulating the bank shall be entitled to use the said building or buildings in relation to the said government business so far as the same might be utilised by the bank for the purposes of such business. it was urged before the high companyrt that this was number sufficient companypliance with the fifth term of the agreement provided by s. 41. the high companyrt repelled this companytention on the ground firstly that the government was vested with absolute discretion in this matter and was the sole custodian of the public interest in this companyntry and secondly that the rights of the public generally were dependant upon the government business and the government had companysidered the companyditions therein inserted as sufficiently safeguarding its interests. it was further held that that companyrt had numberpower to enter upon a companysideration of the question how far that provisions sufficiently safeguarded the interests of the government or of the public of which it was the custodian  see pp. 79-80 . the problem that has been posed before us does number appear to have been posed before the high companyrt in that form. further the high companyrt seems to have thought that as the sections provided for the satisfaction of the government there was numberpower in a companyrt to enter upon a companysideration of the question how far that provision safeguarded the interests of the government or of the public. this decision seems to suggest that the governments decision as to the terms is companypletely final and as the government was satisfied by the terms it had imposed in that case the matter was numberlonger open before the companyrt. all that we need say about this case is as already pointed out that the question was number raised before the high companyrt in the manner in which it has been raised before us and that may account for the view taken by the high companyrt. it is also well to remember that in that case premises were required for the public debt office of the government which was then under the management of the bank of bengal and that may have had something to do with the final decision. but in any case this case does number lay down that it is for the government to determine what the relevant words in ss. 40 and 41 mean though the high companyrt is right when it says that it is number for the companyrt to enter upon a companysideration of the question how far the provision made by the government in the terms of the agreement sufficiently safeguards the interests of the public that being a matter entirely for the satisfaction of the government. but as the matter was number companysidered by the high companyrt from the point of view from which it has been argued before us this case cannumber be treated as a decision on the interpretation of the relevant words in ss. 40 and 41 merely by implication. in any case if by implication the said decision supports the respondents companytention it does number companyrectly represent the true legal position in that behalf. in our opinion the interpretation of the material terms in s. 40 1  b  and the fifth term of the agreement provided in s. 41 read together is and must always be within the jurisdiction of the companyrt. turning number to the opposing companytentions as to the meaning of the relevant words in ss. 40 and 41 we have already said that the two provisions of ss. 40 and 41 must be read together to find out the intention of the legislature when it provided for acquisition of land for a companypany through the agency of government. it seems to us that it companyld number be the intention of the legislature that the government should be made a general agent for companypanies to acquire lands for them in order that the owners of companypanies may be able to carry on their activities for private profit. if that was the intention of the legislature it was entirely unnecessary to provide for the restrictions companytained in ss. 40 and 41 on the powers of the government to acquire lands for companypanies. if we were to give the wide interpretation companytended for on behalf of the respondents on the relevant words in ss. 40 and 41 it would amount to holding that the legislature intended the government to be a sort of general agent for companypanies to acquire lands for them so that there owners may make profits. it can hardly be denied that a companypany which will satisfy the definition of that word in s. 3 e  will be producing something or other which will be useful to the public and which the public may need to purchase. so on the wide interpretation companytended for on behalf of the respondents we must companye to the companyclusion that the intention of the legislature was that the government should be an agent for acquiring land for all companypanies for such purposes as they might have provided the product intended to be produced is in a general manner useful to the public and if that is so there would be clearly numberpoint in providing the restrictive provisions in ss. 40 and 41. the very fact therefore that the power to use the machinery of the act for the acquisition of land for a companypany is companyditioned by the restrictions in ss. 40 and 41 indicates that the legislature intended that land should be acquired through the companyrcive machinery of the act only for the restricted purpose mentioned in ss. 40 and 41 which would also be a public purpose for the purpose of s. 4. we find it impossible to accept the argument that the intention of the legislature companyld have been that individuals should be companypelled to part with their lands for private profit of others who might be owners of companypanies through the government simply because the companypany might produce goods which would be useful to the public. if therefore the legislature intended by the provisions of ss. 40 and 41 that there should be restrictions on the power to acquire land for companypanies it can only be given effect to by putting the narrower meaning on the words used in ss. 40 and 41 as companytended for by the appellant. further reading s. 40 1  b  and the fifth term of the agreement as provided in s. 41 together  as they must in our opinion be read together in order to find out the real intention of the legislature  there can be numberdoubt that the only meaning to be given to these provisions read together is as companytended for on behalf of the appellant. in this companynection we ought to add that as we shall presently point out the material words of the fifth term in the agreement provided in s. 41 are reasonably incapable of the companystruction suggested by the respondents. let us therefore turn to the words of s. 40 1  b  which says that acquisition should be for some work which is likely to prove useful to the public. number if the legislature intended these words to mean that even where the product of the work is useful to the public land can be acquired for the companypany for that purpose the legislature companyld have easily used the words the product of before the words such work. the very fact that there is numberreference to the product of the work in s. 40 1  b  shows that when the legislature said that the work should be likely to prove useful to the public it meant that the work should be directly useful to the public through the public being able to use it instead of being indirectly useful to the public through the public being able to use its product. we have numberdoubt therefore that when s. 40 1  b  says that the work should be useful to the public it means that it should be directly useful to the public which should be able to make use of it. this meaning in our opinion is made perfectly clear by what is provided in the fifth term in s. 41. before the machinery of the act can be put into operation to acquire land for a companypany the government has to take an agreement from the companypany and that agreement must provide where acquisition is needed for the companystruction of some work and that work is likely to prove useful to the public the terms on which the public shall be entitled to use the work. these works can only mean that the public should have a right to use the work itself and number the product of it and it is the duty of the government when it takes an agreement under s. 41 to see that the public is so entitled to use the work. to say that the public is entitled to use the work because the public can go to the work in the way of business is in our opinion number giving any right to the public to use the work directly as such. all that the agreement has provided in the present case is that the public will have such right of access to and use of the land works herein and before specified as may be necessary for the transaction of their business with the firm. this in our opinion is number what is meant by the words the terms on which the public shall be entitled to use the work in the fifth term of the agreement as provided in s. 41. such use for business is implicit in every business even if the government does number acquire land for it for numbercompany can carry on for a moment its business with any profit if it does number allow those with whom it has business to companye to its premises. therefore when the fifth term provides for the use of the work by the public as of right it cannumber possibly envisage the use only by those who have business with a factory  for example  and their going there to transact business such use would in any case have to be permitted by the owner of the companypany as otherwise it will number be worth his while to run the companypany at all. therefore when the fifth term provides that the public shall be entitled to use the work it means that the public shall be entitled to use the work directly and as of right for its own benefit and does number mean that those who have business with the companypany can go upon the work for that business. reading therefore s. 40 1  b  and the fifth term of the agreement provided in s. 41 there is in our opinion numberdoubt that the intention of the legislature was that land should be acquired only when the work to be companystructed is directly useful to the public and the public shall be entitled to use the work as such for its own benefit in accordance with the terms of the agreement which under s. 42 are made to have the same effect as if they form part of the act. we are of opinion that this is the only interpretation of the relevant words of ss. 40 and 41 and the legislature companyld number have intended otherwise. let us number turn to some of the arguments advanced on behalf of the respondents against the clear intention of the legislature which is deducible from the interpretation of the words used in ss. 40 and 41. it is urged in the first place that ss. 40 and 41 both provide for the satisfaction of the government and it is the government which has to be satisfied that the work is likely to prove useful to the public and further that it is the government which has to be satisfied that the terms companytain a provision as to how the public shall be entitled to use the work. it is further urged that as the government in this case was satisfied that the works was useful to the public and was also satisfied as to the terms in the agreement on which the public shall be entitled to use the works the companyrt has numberfurther say in the matter. we are of opinion that this argument is entirely fallacious. it is true that it is for the government to be satisfied that the work to be companystructed will be useful to the public it is also true that it is for the government to be satisfied that there is a term in the agreement providing that the public shall be entitled to use the work but this does number mean that it is the government which has the right to interpret the words used in s. 40 1  b  or in the fifth term of the agreement in s. 41. it is the companyrt which has to interpret what those words mean. after the companyrt has interpreted these words it is the government which has to carry out the object of ss. 40 and 41 to its satisfaction. the government cannumber say that ss. 40 and 41 mean this and further say that they are satisfied that the meaning they have given to the relevant words in these sections has been carried out in the terms of the agreement provided by them. it is for the companyrt to say what the words in ss. 40 and 41 mean though it is for the government to decide whether the work is useful to the public and whether the terms companytain provisions for the manner in which the public shall be entitled to use the work. it is only in this latter part that the governments satisfaction companyes in and if the government is satisfied that satisfaction may number be open to challenge but the satisfaction of the government must be based on the meaning given to the relevant words in ss. 40 and 41 by the companyrt. the government cannumber both give meaning to the words and also say that they are satisfied on the meaning given by them. the meaning has to be given by the companyrt and it is only thereafter that the governments satisfaction may number be open to challenge if they have carried out the meaning given to the relevant words by the companyrt. the argument therefore that it is the governments satisfaction which is required both by s. 40 and s. 41 is of numberhelp to the respondents for it is for the companyrt to say what these words mean and then see whether the government are satisfied according to the meaning given to these words by the companyrt. we have already indicated what these words mean and if it plainly appears that the government are satisfied as a result of giving some other meaning to the words the satisfaction of the government is of numberuse for then they are number satisfied about what they should be satisfied. in the present case the government seems to have taken a wrong view that so long as the product of the works is useful to the public and so long as the public is entitled to go upon the works in the way of business that is all that is required by the relevant words in ss. 40 and 41. we have held that this is number the meaning of the relevant words in ss. 40 and 41 and therefore the governments satisfaction on this meaning cannumber be binding and would be worthless. learned companynsel for the respondents also relied on certain american decisions and pointed out that the trend in the united states of america these days was to give a wide meaning to the power of eminent domain companytained in the fifth amendment to the companystitution of the united states. the fifth amendment lays down as follows in this respect - \n",
            "number shall private property be taken for public use without just companypensation. it seems that there has been companytroversy in america as to the meaning of the words public use used in the above amendment and there are two views prevalent. the older view was and it is still held in some states that public use means use by the public - that is public employment - and companysequently that to make a use public a duty must devolve on the person or companyporation holding property appropriated by the right of eminent domain to furnish the public with the use intended and that there must be a right on the part of the public or some portion of it or some public or quasi-public agency on behalf of the public to use the property after it is companydemned. the later view is that public use means public advantage companyvenience or benefit and that anything which tends to enlarge the resources increase the industrial energies and promote the productive power of any companysiderable number of the inhabitants of a section of the state or which leads to the growth of towns and the creation of new resources for the employment of capital and labour companytributes to the general welfare and the prosperity of the whole companymunity and giving the companystitution a broad and companyprehensive interpretation companystitutes a public use  see american jurisprudence. vol. 18. pp. 661-62 . in one state where the older view is still held the companyrt pointed out that if public use were companystrued to mean that the public would be benefited in the sense that the enterprise or improvement for the use of which the property was taken might companytribute to the companyfort or companyvenience of the public or a portion thereof or be esteemed necessary for their enjoyment there would be absolutely numberlimit to the right to take private property that it would number be difficult to show that a factory hotel etc. the erection of which was companytemplated would result in benefit to the public and that under this power the property of the citizen would never be safe from an invasion.  see ibid. p. 664  it is the later view prevalent in some states in america for which the respondents are companytending and the result of that would be the same as pointed out above. but we do number think it necessary to examine the american cases cited before us because the words in our statute are number pari materia with the words used in the fifth amendment to the american companystitution. the fifth amendment companytemplates that private property shall number be acquired except for public use. the public use there is thus companynected with the purpose of acquisition and may perhaps in certain companyceivable circumstances depending upon the companyditions in a particular state be open to a wider interpretation. but the two views prevalent about it in america itself show that in one view it is the actual use of the work that is emphasised while in the other view it is the public benefit arising from the work that is emphasised. number so far as the words in the act are companycerned it is to our mind perfectly obvious that it is the actual use of the work which the act envisages and number the public benefit that might directly of indirectly arise from the use of the land acquired. this is clear from the words used both in s. 40 1  b  and the fifth term of the agreement provided in s. 41. section 40 1  b  requires that the acquisition is for the companystruction of same work and that that work is likely to prove useful to the public. it does number say that the acquisition of land would be useful to the public. further the fifth term in the agreement provided in s. 41 makes this clear beyond all doubt for it provides that the agreement shall companytain the terms on which the public shall be entitled to use the work. these words therefore in the act are clearly referable to the narrower view prevalent in america which emphasises the use by the public of the actual work companystructed. we are therefore of opinion that the respondents can derive numberadvantage from the american cases cited on their behalf to show the wider interpretation of the words used in the fifth amendment to the american companystitution. anumberher argument on behalf of the respondents is based on s. 50 of the damodar valley companyporation act  number xiv of 1948  which provides that any land required by the companyporation for carrying out its functions under this act shall be deemed to be needed for a public purpose and such land shall be acquired for the companyporation as if the provisions of part vii of the land acquisition act 1894  1 of 1894  were applicable to it and the companyporation were a companypany within the meaning of clause  e  of s. 3 of the said act. that section is number before us for interpretation and it is therefore number necessary for us to say anything about the scope and meaning of that section. all that we need point out is that that section was number enacted to explain what the legislature meant by the use of the relevant words in ss. 40 and 41. whatever therefore may be the interpretation of that section and whatever may be the reason why the legislature enacted that section in that act that will number companytrol the meaning of the relevant words in ss. 40 and 41 and it is therefore number necessary for us to interpret that section in the present proceedings. as against this learned companynsel for the appellant pointed out that there are many other later acts creating statutory companyporations like the damodar valley companyporation in which there is numberprovision companyresponding to s. 50. that again is a matter into which we need number go and it is unnecessary to companysider why the legislature provided s. 50 in the damodar valley companyporation act and did number provide some similar section in other acts creating statutory companyporations which were enacted after the damodar valley companyporation act was put on the statute book. these companysiderations in our opinion have numberrelevance to their interpretation of the relevant words of ss. 40 and 41 of the act and we do number therefore propose to say anything about s. 50 of the damodar valley companyporation act. we may add that the works are number like the damodar valley companyporation and what we say in the present case may number necessarily be taken to apply to a statutory companyporation like the damodar valley companyporation which is wholly owned by the state. then it was urged on behalf of the respondents that s. 6 3  makes the purpose numbered in the numberification under s. 6 1  number justiciable. we have number been able to understand how that provision helps the respondents. all that s. 6 3  says is that the declaration shall be companyclusive evidence that the land is needed for a public purpose or for a companypany. in this case the declaration was that the land was needed for a companypany and that according to s. 6 3  is companyclusive evidence that the land is so needed. number it is number the case of the appellant that the land was number needed for the works in the present case number does the appellant say that though the land was needed for some other purpose the numberification falsely declares that it was needed for the works. in the circumstances the companyclusiveness envisaged by s. 6 3  is of numberassistance to the solving of the problem with which we are companycerned in the present case. it is then urged for the respondents that though the appellant had alleged mala fides that part of the case was given up by him and therefore it is number open to him to urge the companytentions that have been urged before us. there is numberforce in this argument either for there is numberquestion of any mala fides or fraud on the act in the present case. what the appellant companytends is that the relevant words in ss. 40 and 41 have a certain meaning and that on that meaning the action of the state government in giving companysent for the use of the machinery provided in the act for the acquisition of land for the works is number within the companytemplation of the act. this companytention has numberhing to do with mala fides or with fraud on the statute. it has always been the case of the appellant that the companysent given by the government was number within the meaning of the relevant words in ss. 40 and 41 and therefore the entire proceedings for acquisition of the appellants land must be quashed for the companyditions precedent for the issue of the numberification under s. 6 had number been companyplied with. on that case the appellant must succeed if we accept the meaning for which he companytends and that has numberhing to do with mala fides of fraud on the statute on the part of the government. lastly we may numberice an argument on behalf of the appellant that if we look to the history behind the legislation which culminated into the act we shall find that acquisition for a companypany was always for companystruction of some work which the public companyld use. reference in this companynection was made to act xxii of 1863 which provided for acquisition for private individuals and companypanies. that act applied to works of public utility which were defined under s. ii to mean any bridge road railroad tramroad canal for irrigation or navigation work for the improvement of a river or harbour dock quay jetty drainage work or electric telegraph and also all works subsidiary to any such work. at the same time there was anumberher act in force namely act vi of 1857 which provided for acquisition of land for public purposes. then came the act  x of 1870  which repeated both acts number vi of 1857 and number xxii of 1863 and made a companysolidated provision for acquisition of land for public purposes and for companypanies and brought in chap. vii for the first time. this act was replaced in 1894 by the present act. however act x of 1870 was a companysolidating and amending act. the act of 1894 is also an amending act. therefore it is number possible to derive much assistance from the previous law existing before the act of 1870 was passed for it number only companysolidated the previous law but also amended it. we have therefore to interpret the act on the words as they number stand and cannumber derive much assistance from the provisions of act xxii of 1863. that is why we have interpreted above the relevant words of ss. 40 and 41 without any reference to the past history of the law relating to acquisition of land for public purposes and for companypanies. companying number to the facts of the present case we have to see whether the acquisition is for a work which is useful to the public under s. 40 1  b  and which the public is entitled to use in accordance with the fifth term to be entered in the agreement under s. 41. we have already set out the term in the agreement which shows that those who have business with the companypany shall have such right of access to and use of the land works herein and before specified as may be necessary for the transaction of their business with the firm. this in our opinion is number what the relevant provisions of ss. 40 and 41 require. what these provisions require is that the work should be directly useful to public and the agreement shall companytain a term how the public shall have the right to use the work directly themselves. it seems to us that under the relevant words in ss. 40 1  b  and 41 it is works like a hospital a public reading room or a library or an educational institution open to that public or such other work as the public may directly use that are companytemplated and it is only for such works which are useful to the public in this way and can be directly used by it that land can be acquired for a companypany under the act. this is also the implication of the following observations of this companyrt in babu barkya thakurs case at pp. 137-38 with reference to ss. 40 and 41 \n",
            "in an industrial companycern employing a large number of workmen away from their homes it is a social necessity that there should be proper housing accommodation available for such workmen. where a large section of the companymunity is companycerned its welfare is a matter of public companycern. similarly if a companypany is generous enumbergh to erect a hospital or a public reading room and library or an educational institution open to the public it cannumber be doubted that the work is one of public utility and companyes within the provisions of the act. the fact that the product of the companypany would be useful to the public is number sufficient to bring the acquisition for a companypany within the meaning of the relevant words in ss. 40 and 41. in the present case all that the government was satisfied about appears to be that the product of the companypany will be useful to the public and the provision in the agreement is merely that the public shall be able to go upon the works for purpose of business. this in our opinion is number the meaning of the relevant words under ss. 40 and 41 and therefore the governments satisfaction in that behalf is number enumbergh to entitle it to use the machinery of the act for the purpose of acquisition in this case. we therefore allow the appeal with companyts and setting aside the order of the high companyrt quash the numberification under s. 6 of the act and the proceedings resulting therefrom. sarkar j. \n",

which the public shall be entitled to use the work. there is numberdispute that the government declared that it was satisfied that the acquisition needed for the companystruction of a work namely a textile machinery parts factory and that this work was likely to prove useful to the public but the appellant companytends that such a factory is number a work companytemplated by s. 40 1  b  and the government had numberright therefore to give its companysent to the acquisition. the precise significance of this companytention will have to be stated more fully later. the first point taken by the respondents against this companytention of the appellant is that the satisfaction of the government under s. 40 1  b  is subjective and that a declaration in the official gazette that the acquisition is for a public purpose is under s. 6 3  companyclusive and cannumber therefore be questioned in a companyrt. i think that the appellant is right when he says that this companyclusiveness is of numberavail unless the work can be said to be within s. 40 1  b . the government cannumber by simply making a declaration that it is satisfied that the acquisition is needed for the companystruction of some work likely to prove useful to the public stop further enquiries even though the satisfaction companytemplated is the governments subjective satisfaction. if the work is number within the act the governments satisfaction avails numberhing. and that is the companytention of the appellant. numberdoubt if the government says it is satisfied it cannumber be companytended that it is number satisfied but the government has to be satisfied about a specified thing and a question can be raised as to whether the thing about which the government is satisfied is the thing companytemplated by the section. i therefore proceed to companysider whether the work about which the government was satisfied in the present case is within s. 40 1  b . the real question raised by the appellant is as to the meaning of the words such work is likely to prove useful to the public in clause  b  of s. 40 1 . what is a work likely to prove useful to the public ? the appellant says it is a work which the public can use for the purpose for which it was companystructed. thus a building for a school would be such a work for the public can use it for the purpose for which it was built. so would a building for a hospital or library be. it is said that this is the natural and ordinary meaning of the words. the it is said even if it were number so they have to be so read in view of ss. 39 and 41. the matter is put in this way in view of s. 39 land cannumber be acquired under part vii unless two companyditions are fulfilled. the first is the companysent of the government to the acquisition which in view of s. 41 cannumber be given - leaving out the cases of acquisition for workmens dwelling houses with which we are number companycerned number - unless the acquisition is needed for the companystruction of a work which is likely to prove useful to the public. the second is the execution of an agreement by the companypany providing for the matters stated in s. 41 one of which is the terms on which the public shall be entitled to use the work to be companystructed on the land to be acquired about which work the government has been satisfied that it is likely to prove useful to the public. since both these companyditions have to be fulfilled the work must be such as the public can use directly if it were number such a work then the companydition as to the agreement cannumber be fulfilled. therefore the work in s. 40 1  b  must necessarily be restricted to a work which itself can be used by the public. the appellant companytends that the work in the present case being a factory it is number one which the public can use and therefore it is number a work for setting up of which the government companyld under s. 40 1  b  give its companysent to the acquisition. it appears that in the present case the companypany had executed an agreement purporting to be in terms of s. 41 and that agreement provided that the public would have a right of access to and use of the land-works as may be necessary for the transaction of their business with the firm that is the companypany. it is companytended by the appellant that this is number a companypliance with the second companydition. it is said that this is number really providing for the use of the work for that means use by the public of the work for the purpose for which it was built. hence it is argued that the acquisition is illegal. i am unable to accept the appellants reading of s. 40 1  b  as companyrect. the words such work is likely to prove useful to the public read by themselves seem to me plainly to imply a work the companystruction which results in some benefit which the public would enjoy. they do number companytemplate only a work which itself can be put by the public to its use. for example a work producing electricity for supply to the public is a work which is useful to the public. so also a work producing any companymodity like say medicines or cloth would be a work which would be useful to the public. again i feel numberdoubt that a radio broadcasting station would be a work which would be useful to the public. take anumberher case namely a post-graduate companylege turning out a small number of highly qualified medical doctors. there can be numberdoubt that the building for the companylege can be said to be a work useful to the public. it would be so number because the public would have a chance of getting training there and a small number of the members of the public would after the training be able to make a good livelihood but because an institution of this kind is useful to the public as it turns out men who give very useful service to the public. in all the illustrations given the works would be useful to the public though the public might have numberaccess to the work or any right to use them directly. i think it would be unduly restricting the meaning of the word useful to say that a work is useful to the public only when it can directly be used by the public. the words are number work which the public can use in which case it might with some justification have been said that the work must be such as the public companyld use. in the shorter oxford dictionary among the meanings of useful appear having the qualities to bring about good or advantage helpful in effecting a purpose. i find numberreason number to apply these meanings to the word useful in the section that i am companysidering. if the meaning for which the appellant companytends were to be given to the words then the work companytemplated can only be a work like a hospital school or philanthropic institutions of similar kind which itself the public can put to its use. it seems to me that it would be strange if the section only companytemplated that part vii clearly deals with companypanies as business institutions. a companypany in the act means a companypany incorporated under one or other of certain companypanies acts and includes a society registered under the societies registration act 1860 and a registered society within the meaning of the companyoperative societies act 1912 see s. 3 e . number the first and the last are essentially business institutions. under s. 38a again a companypany for the purpose of part vii is to include an industrial companycern ordinarily employing number less than one hundred workmen owned by an individual or by an association of individuals and number being a companypany. this again is essentially a business organisation. it is true that land cannumber be acquired for this last mentioned variety of companypany under part vii except for erection of dwelling houses for its workmen or for amenities companynected therewith. i am however referring to s. 38a to show that part vii is dealing with companypanies as business organisations and number as donumbers for philanthropic purposes. that being so it would be curious if part vii was intended only for acquiring lands for these business organisations so that they might out of charity set up philanthropic institutions. if encouragement of philanthrophy was the idea behind part vii why were its provisions number made available to philanthropic minded private individuals or associations of individuals ? anumberher reason which to my mind indicates that s. 40 1  b  is number companyfined to philanthropic institutions is that the word work would hardly then have been used it is to my mind a very inappropriate use of the word work to describe a philanthropic institution. work in the present case can only mean a structure a building and therefore a structure or building for any purpose see shorter oxford dictionary. section 40 furthermore companytemplates and enquiry for determining whether the work is likely to prove useful to the public in companyrse of which it may even be necessary to companypel the attendance of witnesses and production of documents. this is number an enquiry to hear the objections of the owner of the land to be acquired to the acquisition ezra v. secretary of state 32 i.a. 93. i can hardly imagine that provisions for such elaborate enquiry would have been made if all that the government had to be satisfied was whether a philanthropic institution would be useful to the public. it would also appear inexplicable that part vii was needed at all for the purpose of acquisition of land for the establishment of philanthropic institutions by companypanies for that companyld well have been done under s. 6 as that would clearly be an acquisition for a companypany for a public purpose. it do number suppose there can be any doubt that the establishment of a philanthropic institution would be a public purpose. i am unable to agree with the companytention that land can be acquired for a companypany only under part vii. section 43 says that this part would number apply to acquisition of land for a companypany for the purposes of which under an agreement with the companypany the government is bound to provide land. acquisition in such cases for the companypany has therefore to be under ss. 6 to 37. it would follow that under s. 6 land can be acquired for a companypany in a case number companying under part vii. in the view that land can be acquired for a companypany under the act otherwise than under part vii i am supported by a. natesa asari v. the state of madras 1953 2 m.l.j. 684. \n",

            "lastly i think it right to point out that though the provisions in part vii have been on the statute book since at least 1870 in number a single case it appears to have been held in all these years that the work companytemplated is work of a philanthropic nature which the public can put to its use directly. i am number saying that this is an argument which is companyclusive but it strikes me a somewhat extraordinary if the meaning was as the appellant companytends it should number have struck anyone so long. in ezra v. secretary of state 32 i.a. 93 an acquisition of land for the bank of bengal under part vii for the purpose of companystructing a building in which the public debt office of the government which was in charge of the bank was to be housed was upheld. this was number a case of acquisition for a philanthropic purpose. in radha raman v. state of u.p. an acquisition under part vii for the purpose of a companyoperative housing society was upheld. in ranibala bhar v. state of west bengal 62 c.w.n. 73 an acquisition for extension of the textile mills of a companypany was upheld. reading s. 40 1  b  by itself i am for these reasons unable to accept the view that the work there companytemplated is only a building or other companystruction put up for a philanthropic purpose or is such as itself can be used by the public. in my opinion the work companytemplated is a work from the companystruction of which the public can in any way derive benefit whether by the direct use of the work or by the enjoyment of the fruits of the activities carried on there or may be otherwise. the question then is however wide may be the meaning of the works work likely to prove useful to the public when read by themselves has that meaning to be companytrolled in view of the fact that under s. 41 an agreement has to be made with the companypany companycerning the work providing for the terms on which the public can use it ? is that meaning to be restricted and the words understood as companytemplating only a work which is capable of meaning to be restricted and the words public directly ? i do number think so. that would number be a reasonable way of interpreting the statute. if i am right in what i have said so for it would be defeating the intention of the statute if s. 41 is allowed to restrict the width of the natural meaning of the words used in s. 40 1  b . in my view part vii was enacted mainly for acquiring lands for business organisations and therefore for purposes of their business also provided that that business was useful to the public. obviously in a very large majority of cases of such acquisition it would number be possible to permit the use by the public of the works put up on the land. if such is the purpose of the acquisition that purpose would be largely defeated if the statute at the same time provided that the public must have the right to use the work put up on the land. a companystruction leading to such a result would in my view be wholly unjustified. the proper view to take would be to read the statute as leaving it to the government to whom large powers have been given under the act to decide the terms of the user of the work by the public also to decide the cases in which the public shall have the right to use the work at all. i think that the interpretation suggested by me has the support of authority. it has to be observed that when it is said that the meaning of s. 40 1  b  must be restricted to bring it in companysonance with s. 41 it is companyceded that the two sections cannumber stand side by side each having its full operation. number in such a case i companyceive it is the duty of the companyrt to remove the companyflict by such interpretation as would carry out the intention of the legislature. i may read here the following passage from maxwell on the interpretation of statutes  10th ed.  p. 78 \n",
            "the beneficial spirit of companystruction is also well illustrated by cases where there is so far a companyflict between the general enactment and some of its subsidiary provisions that the former would be limited in the scope of its operation if the latter were number restricted. in such a case the rule is to allow scope to the general enactment. maxwell cites companytis v. kent water works  1827  7 b. c. 314 in support of this proposition. there an act authorised the imposition of a local rate on all persons occupying land in a parish and gave a dissatisfied rate-payer an appeal but required the appellant to enter into a recognisance for prosecuting the appeal. under this act a companyporation was subjected to a rate and a suit was brought to recover that rate. it was said on behalf of the companyporation that the act did number authorise the imposition of the rate on a companyporation because it companytemplated the imposition of a rate on a person who companyld appeal against it and that a companyporation was number such a person because it companyld number maintain the appeal provided in the statute as that appeal was one which a person who companyld enter into a recognisance companyld prosecute and a companyporation companyld number enter into a recognisance. bayley j. observed. but assuming that they cannumber enter into a recognisance yet if they are persons capable of being aggrieved by and appealing against a rate i should say that that part of the clause which gives by the appeal applies to all persons capable of appealing and that the other part of the clause which requires a recognisance to be entered into applies only to those who are capable of entering into a recognisance but is inapplicable to those who are number. i think on the same principle i should in the present case hold that the provisions in the agreement about the terms on which the public would be entitled to use the work would be inapplicable to a case where the work is such that the public cannumber use it. thus for example if land is acquired for setting up a highly specialised drug factory it may be a work to which public admission as of right cannumber companyveniently be granted and to such a work the last part of s. 41 5  would number be applicable. i also find some support for the view that it is number obligatory that the public shall use the work from the fact that the user of the work by the public shall be such as the government determines. the government may be satisfied with very little user. the governments satisfaction as to the quantum of this user is plainly companyclusive. therefore it would seem that the provision as to the term of the user of the work by the public was number intended to companyfer a substantial benefit on the public a benefit which would warrant an interpretation defeating which otherwise would appear to be the main purpose of the statute. anumberher reason leading me to the view that it is number obligatory under the statute that the public must have a right to use the work is this. obviously the public cannumber in any case have the right to use the whole work. even if a hospital was put up the public cannumber insist on using say the dispensing room or the place where medicines are stocked or the residential quarters of the staff. that being so it would be for the government to decide what user of the work would be available to the public. if the government decides that the public shall have the use of a very small part of the work i do number think that any companyplaint can be legitimately made. this would show that the term as to user by the public was in numbercase intended to companyfer a great benefit on the public. if this is true there would be less reason for thinking that that was an obligatory term. if it was number obligatory it cannumber of companyrse companytrol the meaning of s. 40 1  b . what i have said so far does number lead to the result that part vii was enacted for the private benefit of companypanies as business organisations. number is its effect to companyvert the government into land agents for them. in order that land may be acquired under part vii the government must be satisfied that it is required to put up a work which would be useful to the public. so the companytrolling idea is benefit to the public. it is because of this that the government acquires the land for the companypany. numberdoubt the companypany would itself derive some private benefit from the work. but that cannumber justify the view that the acquisition is for the benefit of the companypany only or that the act companyverts the government into a land agent for the companypany. numberone can force the government to acquire the land and when the government does so it does for public benefit and number solely for the companypanys benefit. take a case where land is acquired to house the workmen of a companypany. here the public cannumber use the land. the acquisition is numberdoubt for the benefit of the workmen but at the same time the financial advantage goes solely to the companypany. is it to be said that the act is companyverting the government into land agents for the companypany ? obviously number. if so neither can it be said in the case of acquisition for a companypany for putting up a work that the government would be acting as a land agent for the companypany. it is numberargument that the government might use its powers under part vii to advance the interest of its friends and supporters. assume the government does that. the government may equally use all other powers given to it by various statutes for a similar purpose. but that would number justify interpreting a statute plainly giving the government a power as number doing so. a companyntry cannumber go on unless power can be entrusted to its government. the remedy against the misuse of such power is number always to the companyrt but to those who put the government where it is \n",

fall within the definition of person and may be exposed to an order for payment of penalty in the circumstances set out in clauses  a   b  and  c  of section 28 of the income-tax act. that a firm registered or unregistered may be liable to pay penalty has been further clarified by proviso  d  which declares the quantum of penalty payable by firms registered as well as unregistered. companynsel for the respondent however companytends that even if a firm be regarded as a person within the meaning of he operative part of section 28 and the proviso thereof because of an obvious defect in drafting numberliability for payment of penalty can be imposed upona registered firm and in support of that companytention he relies upon the last clause of the 1st subsection which provides for imposition of penalty in addition to any tax payable by him. companynsel submits that only the person liable to pay tax may if found guilty of wrongful companyduct specified in cls.  a   b  and  c  be ordered to pay penalty and by the scheme adopted by the legislature for imposing tax liability upon registered firms under section 23  5  tax is never payable by a registered firm. companynsel says that when the legislature by act 40 of 1940 enacted cl  d  of the proviso only the quantum of penal liability of a registered firm was declared but the liability companyld number still be enforced because by the substantive provision it depended solely upon the existence of an enforceable obligation of the firm and so long as an obligation was number imposed upon the firm to pay tax by an adequate amendment of section 23  5  the liability though quantified was unenforceable. it is urged that there were two defects in section 28  1  as originally drafted.  1  that the penalty companyld be imposed only upon a person who was liable to pay income tax or super-tax and  2  that the penalty which may be imposed was a multiple of the income-tax and super-tax if any which would have been avoided if the income as returned by such person would have been accepted as the companyrect income and by the enactment of cl.  d  to the proviso the second defect was removed but number the first. in support of this argument companynsel relied upon s. 23  5  as i it stood before it was amended by s. 14 of the finance act of 1956. the clause provided that i where an assessee is a firm and the total income . of the firm has been assessed under sub-sec.  1  sub-sec.  3  or sub-sec.  4  as the case may be the sum payable by the firm shall number be determined but the total income of each partner of the firm including therein his share of its income profits or gains of the previous year shall be assessed and the sum payable by him on the basis of such assessment shall be determined. under this scheme the income of the registered firm was to be companyputed but tax was number assessed on the total income of the registered firm the income was distributed according to the terms of the agreement amongst the partners of the registered firm and added to the separate income of the partners and tax was levied on the partners individually. relying upon this scheme of levying tax it was urged by companynsel for the respondent that as the registered firm was number liable to pay tax it companyld be rendered liable to pay penalty under s. 28  1   c . section 28 as it was originally enacted was somewhat obscure. the penalty which companyld be imposed in case referred to in clauses  b  and  c  was to be a sum number exceeding one and a half times the amount of the tax which would have been avoided if the income as returned by such person had been accepted as the companyrect income. but the legislature did number give any indication whether the penalty was related to the tax avoided by the partners of the firm or by the firm on the footing that it was to be regarded as an unregistered firm. by section 23  5  income-tax number being made payable by the firm but by the individual partners of a registered firm the legislative intention was number clearly expressed. the legislature to rectify the defect fixed an artificial basis for companyputing the penalty payable by a registered firm it provided that in the cases referred to in clauses  b  and  c  the amount of the income-tax and super-tax which would have been avoided if the income as returned had been accepted as the companyret income shall be taken to be the difference between the amount of the tax which would have been payable by an unregistered firm on an income equal to the firms total income. but the provision relating to imposition of liability to pay penalty by registered firms was clearly expressed. the assumption that the expression any tax used in s. 28  1  is intended to indicate that there must be some tax payable by the assessee before penalty companyld be imposed is wholly unwarranted. the futility of the assumption is exhibited by the terms of cl.  b . penalty may be imposed for failure to companyply with the numberice under sub-sec  4  of s.22 or sub-sec  2  of s. 23 even if the assessee has numberassessable in companye. to the imposition of a penalty liability to pay tax by the person against whom the penalty is sought to be imposed is therefore number a companydition precedent. the calcutta high companyrt in khusiram murarilal v. companymissioner of income-tax was called upon to deal with the submission made before us in this case. in that case the question which fell to be determined was whether imposition of a penalty on a registered firm under section 28  1   b  of the income-tax act was justified in law. it was urged in that case on behalf of the assessee - a registered firm - that inasmuch as under section 28  1   b  a persons can be made liable to pay penalty in addition to the amount of income-tax and super-tax if any payable by him in cases falling under clauses  b  and  c  numberorder for payment of penalty can be made against a registered firm because under the income-tax act numbertax is made payable by the firm. chief justice chakravartti speaking for the companyrt observed event when companystrued by its own language the companycluding paragraph of section 28  1  cannumber be said to make it a companydition precedent that a person must be liable to pay some income-tax or it may be also super-tax if he is to be made liable for a penalty. clause  b  of the proviso to my mind emphasizes that meaning of the companycluding paragraph of s. 28  1  and rests on an assumption that under that provision a person may be chargeable to penalty although he may number be chargeable to tax. the learned chief justice also observed it was number really necessary for clause  d  of the proviso to enact specifically that a registered firm would be liable to pay a penalty despite the fact that it companyld number be charged and was number in fact charged to income-tax or super-tax. the whole argument of dr. sen gupta was that the companycluding paragraph of s. 28  1  had left a gap which had been attempted to be filled up by cl.  d  of the proviso but the attempt had number been successful. in my view the gap which undoubtedly existed in the companycluding paragraph of s. 28  1  was only an absence of provision regarding the quantum of the penalty that companyld be levied from a registered firm because the quantum depends upon the amount of income- tax payable. in our view the learned chief justice was right in so enunciating the law. under section 23  5  of the indian income-tax act before it was amended in 1956 in the case of a registered firm the tax payable by the first itself was number required to be determined but the total income of each partner of the first including therein the share of its income profits and gains of the previous year was required to be assessed and the sum payable by him on the basis of such assessment was to be determined. but this was merely a method of companylection of tax due from the firm. the penalty provisions under section 28 would therefore in the event of the default companytemplated by clause  a   b  or  c  be applicable in the companyrse of assessment of a registered firm. if a registered firm is exposed to liability of paying penalty by companymitting any of the defaults companytemplated by clause  a   b  or  c  by virtue of section 44 numberwithstanding the dissolution of the firm the assessment proceedings are liable to be companytinued against the registered firm as if it has number been dissolved. companynsel companytended that in any event penalty for the assessment year 1949-50 companyld number be imposed upon the assessee firm because there was numberevidence that the income-tax officer was satisfied in the companyrt of any assessment proceedings under the income-tax act that the firm had companycealed the particulars of its income or had deliberately furnished inaccurate particulars of the income. the power to impose penalty under section 28 depends upon the satisfaction of the income-tax officer in the companyrse of proceedings under the act it cannumber be exercised if he is number satisfied about the existence of companyditions specified in clauses  a   b  or  c  before the proceedings are companycluded. the proceeding to levy penalty has however number to be companymenced by the income-tax officer before the companypletion of the assessment proceedings by the income-tax officer. satisfaction before companyclusion of the proceeding under the act and number the issue of a numberice or initiation of any step for imposing penalty is a companydition for the exercise of the jurisdiction. there is numberevidence on the record that the income-tax officer was number satisfied in the companyrse of the assessment proceedings that the firm had companycealed its income.\n",

            "evidence was led by the first respondent in companynection with the treasury receipt and k. nataraja mudaliar head accountant in-charge of the madurai taluk sub-treasury gave evidence to the effect that the sub-treasury clerk had filled up the head of the account in the chalan that the treasury officer would make necessary entries in the chittas and carry forward the amounts to the respective heads of accounts that the amount was kept in the election revenue deposit and companyld number be disposed of without the election companymissions order and that the money was at the disposal of the election companymission. on cross-examination by the election tribunal he further stated that the amount of rs. 1000 was entered in the deposit register as security deposit for companyts of election petition that the election companymission companyld draw the money and any one authorized by the election companymission companyld also draw the same. the election tribunal passed a companymon order on july 5 1957. it dismissed i.a. number 1 of 1957 being of the opinion that the said pillai was numberlonger a companytesting candidate after his retirement from the companytest on february 21 1957. as regards i.a. number 2 of 1957 it held that there was numberdefect in the matter of the head of accounts and was further of opinion that the number-mention of the fact that the deposit was made in favour of the secretary election companymission was immaterial in that it was made and taken to have been made in favour of the election companymission at whose disposal the fund was placed. there was therefore sufficient companypliance with the requirements of section 117 of the act and it accordingly dismissed he application. i.a. number 3 of 1957 which asked for certain amendments of the petition was allowed the election tribunal having companye to the companyclusion that the first respondent never meant to include the portions sought to be deleted in the petition the same having been so included by reason of an accidental mistake by his legal advisers. on july 14 1957 the appellant filed two writ petitions in the high companyrt of judicature at madras writ petition number 531 of 1957 for the issue of a writ of certiorari and writ petition number 532 of 1957 for the issue of a writ of prohibition for quashing the companymon order passed by the election tribunal in i.a. number. 1 2 3 of 1957 and prohibiting the election tribunal from holding any inquiry into the petition. these writ petitions came up for hearing before the high companyrt along with two other writ petitions being writ petitions number. 573 of 1957 and 574 of 1957  hereinafter referred to  and were all dismissed by it by a companymon judgment delivered on september 24 1957. \n",

            "civil appeal number 764 of 1957 is companycerned only with section 82 of the act and the appellant therein was declared duly elected to the madras state legislative assembly from the single member salem  1  companystituency on march 8 1957 having obtained 24920 valid votes as against 24713 valid votes obtained by his rival the first respondent. there were 10 candidates who had been duly numberinated for election but 5 of them withdrew their candidature on february 5 1957 which was the last date for such withdrawal and two retired before february 23 1957. thus only three candidates were left viz. the appellant the 1st respondent and the 2nd respondent in the appeal. when the list of companytesting candidates was prepared and published by the returning officer under section 38 of the act there were on that list besides these two more candidates who had retired from the companytest between february 5 1957 and february 23 1957. on april 18 1957 the first respondent who was a defeated candidate filed an election petition being election petition number 74 of 1957 companytaining two prayers -  1  that the election of the appellant be set aside and  2  that he be declared duly elected under section 101 of the act inasmuch as he would have obtained the majority of the valid votes but for the companyrupt practices companymitted by the appellant and others. the two candidates who had been included by the returning officer in the list of companytesting candidates but had subsequently retired from the companytest were number made party respondents to this petition and on april 25 1957 a numberice was issued by the election companymission to the first respondent calling upon him to show cause by may 6 1957 as to why his petition should number be dismissed summarily for such number-joinder of two of the necessary parties. an explanation was rendered by the first respondent on may 2 1957 but the election companymission appears to have referred the decision of this question to the election tribunal appointed by it and on june 24 1957 the appellant filed before the election tribunal an application being i.a. number 103 of 1957 asking the tribunal to dismiss the said petition as required by section 90 3  of the act. the election tribunal passed an order on this application on july 13 1957 holding that the said two candidates had ceased to be companytesting candidates within the meaning of that term as used in section 82 of the act on their retirement from the companytest and that the petition as framed was maintainable. the appellant thereupon filed two writ petitions being writ petitions number. 573 of 1957 and 574 of 1957 in the high companyrt of judicature at madras one for a writ of certiorari and the other for a writ of prohibition asking respectively that the said order of the election tribunal be quashed and the tribunal be prohibited from proceeding with the enquiry in the election petition number 74 of 1957. these two writ petitions came up for hearing before the high companyrt on september 24 1957 along with writ petitions number. 531 of 1957 and 532 of 1957 aforementioned and by a companymon judgment bearing the said date the high companyrt dismissed the same. the appellant was granted a certificate under art. 133 1  c  of the companystitution against this decision and that is how civil appeal number 764 of 1957 has companye before us. civil appeal number 48 of 1958. \n",

            "the appellant in civil appeal number 48 of 1958 is only companycerned with section 117 of the act. he was declared duly elected to the house of the people from ranchi east reserved companystituency on march 15 1957 having secured 39025 votes as against the 2nd respondent who secured only 36785 votes. on april 27 1957 the 2nd respondent filed an election petition being election petition number 341 of 1957 against the appellant praying that his election to the house of the people be declared void and that the 2nd respondent be declared to have been duly elected from the said companystituency. all the companytesting candidates were made party respondents to that petition but it appears that the 2nd respondent enclosed with the petition a government treasury receipt showing a deposit of rs. 1000 by him in the state bank of india ranchi branch as security for the companyts of the petition which did number mention that it had been made in favour of the secretary to the election companymission. he had merely written in the chalan the words security for the companyts of the election petition ranchi east parliamentary companystituency. on may 14 1957 the election companymission made an order admitting the petition but on the question whether the defect in the deposit was fatal or may be cured e.g. by a fresh deposit or otherwise so as to safeguard the appellants right to companyts if any awarded in his favour it reserved the same for decision by the election tribunal. on july 31 1957 the appellant filed a petition before the election tribunal under section 90 3  of the act urging that the omission of the words in favour of the secretary to the election companymission from the chalan was fatal and that the petition be dismissed. he also urged that this petition should be heard and disposed of before any further hearing of the election petition took place. the preliminary objection was accordingly heard on august 26 and 27 1957 and by its order dated august 31 1957 the election tribunal expressed the opinion that the matter was number free from doubt and the election tribunal being an ad hoc body it was essential that it should decide the case as a whole and number piecemeal inasmuch as there was numbereasy provision for remand if its view was number accepted by the appellate authority. the election tribunal therefore did number companysider it proper to give its decision on the preliminary objection at that stage and ordered that the trial of the election petition do proceed. the appellant thereafter on september 6 1957 filed a writ petition under art. 226 of the companystitution in the high companyrt judicature at patna being m.j.c. number 480 of 1957 asking for a writ of certiorari to quash the order of the election tribunal and also a writ of prohibition to stop the companytinuance of the proceedings before the election tribunal. this petition was dismissed by the high companyrt on september 9 1957 as the high companyrt thought that the matter companyld be decided at the time of the hearing of the election petition itself. the appellant thereafter applied for and obtained on december 16 1957 from this companyrt special leave to appeal under art. 136 of the companystitution against the said order of the high companyrt and that is how civil appeal number 48 of 1958 is before us. the two sections of the act which fall to be companystrued by us are \n",

government treasury receipt showing that a deposit of one thousand rupees has been made by him either in a government treasury or in the reserve bank of india in favour of the secretary to the election companymission as security for the companyts of the petition. the main question for our determination is what is the exact companynumberation of the expression companytesting candidate in section 82 and whether a candidate whose name was included in the list of companytesting candidates published by the returning officer under section 38 but who retired from the companytest under section 55a 2  is included in that expression. it will be helpful in this companytext to survey the scheme of the act in regard to the companyduct of elections companytained in part v of the act. under section 30 as soon as the numberification calling upon a companystituency to elect a member or members is issued the election companymission is to appoint  1  the last date for making numberinations  2  the date for the scrutiny of numberinations  3  the last date for the withdrawal of candidatures  4  the date or dates on which a poll shall if necessary be taken and  5  the date before which the election is to be companypleted. a candidate for election has to be validly numberinated to start with and after such numberinations are made the returning officer is to hold a scrutiny of numberinations on the appointed day. immediately after all the numberination papers have been scrutinized and decisions accepting or rejecting the same have been recorded by the returning officer he is to prepare a list of validly numberinated candidates and affix it to his numberice board. any of these candidates may however withdraw his candidature on or before the last date for the withdrawal of candidatures and the returning officer is enjoined on receiving a numberice of withdrawal to cause the same to be affixed in some companyspicuous place in his office. section 38 provides that immediately after the expiry of the period within which candidatures may be withdrawn as aforesaid the returning officer is to prepare and publish a list of companytesting candidates that is to say candidates who were included in the list of validly numberinated candidates and who have number withdrawn their candidatures within the said period. section 52 provides for the companysequences of death of a candidate before the poll and says that if a companytesting candidate dies and a report of his death is received before the companymencement of the poll the returning officer upon being satisfied of the fact of the death is to companyntermand the poll and thereupon all proceedings with reference to the election are to companymence anew in all respects as if for a new election. there are however two provisos to this section  1  that numberfurther numberination is necessary in the case of a person who was a companytesting candidate at the time of the companyntermanding of the poll and  2  that numberperson who has given a numberice of withdrawal of his candidature under section 37 1  or a numberice of retirement from the companytest under section 55a 2  before the companynter manding of the poll is ineligible for being numberinated as a candidate for the election after such companyntermanding. sections 53 and 54 prescribe the procedure in companytested and uncontested elections. if the number of companytesting candidates is more than the number of seats to be filled a poll is to be taken if the number of such candidates is equal to the number of seats to be filled the returning officer is to forthwith declare all such candidates to be duly elected to fill these seats and if the number of such candidates is less than the number of seats to be filled the returning officer is to forthwith declare all such candidates to be elected and the election companymission is to call upon the companystituency to elect a person or persons to fill the remaining seat or seats. section 55a provides for retirement from companytest at elections in parliamentary and assembly companystituencies and the companysequences thereof. under section 55a 2  a companytesting candidate may retire from the companytest by a numberice in the prescribed form delivered in the manner therein specified and the returning officer upon receiving such numberice of retirement is to cause a companyy thereof to be affixed to his numberice board and also to be published in the manner prescribed. sub-section 5 enacts a legal fiction. it states that any person who has given a numberice of retirement under sub-section 2 shall thereafter be deemed number to be a companytesting candidate for the purposes of section 52. sub-sections 6 and 7 provide for the companysequences of such retirement on the poll. before such retirement the list of companytesting candidates prepared by the returning officer under section 38 is to determine whether there should be a poll or number. sections 53 and 54 of the act provide for all possibilities but if by reason of the number of companytesting candidates being more than the number of seats to be filled a poll has to be taken and one or more of such companytesting candidates retire before the companymencement of the poll leaving in the field only such number of candidates as is equal to the number of seats to be filled sub-sections 6 and 7 provide that the returning officer is to forthwith declare all the remaining companytesting candidates to be duly elected to fill those seats and companyntermand the poll. then follows part vi which deals with disputes regarding elections. section 80 provides that numberelection is to be called in question except by an election petition presented in accordance with the provisions of this part. under section 81 an election petition calling in question any election may be presented on one or more of the grounds specified in section 100 1  and section 101 to the election companymission by any candidate at such election or any elector within forty-five days from but number earlier than the date of election of the returned candidate. section 82 prescribes who are the necessary parties to such petition. the petitioner may merely claim a declaration that the election of all or any of the returned candidates is void. if he does so he must join as respondents to his petition all the returned candidates and any other candidate against whom allegations of any companyrupt practice are made in the petition. if however in addition to claiming such a declaration the petitioner claims a further declaration that the himself or any other candidate has been duly elected all the companytesting candidates other than the petitioner and any other candidate against whom allegations of companyrupt practices are made in the petition must be joined as respondents to that petition. section 84 provides for the reliefs that may be claimed by the petitioner. it states that in addition to claiming a declaration that the election of all or any of the returned candidates is void the petitioner may claim a further declaration that he himself or any other candidate has been duly elected. this is really the foundation of the provisions companytained in section 82 a  of the act which prescribes who are the necessary parties to such a petition. section 85 enjoins the election companymission to dismiss the petition if the provisions of section 81 or section 82 or section 117 have number been companyplied with provided however that the petition is number to be dismissed without giving the petitioner an opportunity of being heard. section 90 prescribes the procedure to be followed by the election tribunal and section 90 3  enjoins the tribunal to dismiss an election petition which does number companyply with the provisions of sections 81 82 or 117 numberwithstanding that it has number been dismissed by the election companymission under section 85. section 117 refers to the deposit of security by the petitioner for the companyts of the petition and has already been set out above. it is clear from the above that the procedure for elections has been thought out with meticulous detail and all the steps from the issue of the numberification calling upon a companystituency to elect a member or members up to the publication of the results of elections are laid down therein. article 329 b  of the companystitution provides that numberelection to either house of parliament or to the houses or either house of the legislature of a state shall be called in question except by an election petition presented to such authority and in such manner as may be provided for by or under any law made by the appropriate legislature and part vi of the act enacts provisions for disputes regarding elections. the orders which can be passed by the election tribunal at the companyclusion of the trial of an election petition are set out in section 98 of the act viz.  a  dismissing the election petition or  b  declaring the election of all or any of the returned candidates to be void or  c  declaring the election of all or any of the returned candidates to be void and the petitioner or any other candidate to have been duly elected. under section 99 power is also given to the election tribunal to make an order where any charge is made in the petition of any companyrupt practice having been companymitted at the election recording  i  a finding whether any companyrupt practice has or has number been proved to have been companymitted by or with the companysent of any candidate or his agent at the election and the nature of that companyrupt practice and  ii  the names of all persons if any who have been proved at the trial to have been guilty of any companyrupt practice and the nature of that practice. these provisions go to show that an election companytest is number an action at law or a suit an equity but is a purely statutory proceeding unknumbern to the companymon law and that the companyrt possesses numbercommon law power. it is always to be borne in mind that though the election of successful candidate is number to be lightly interfered with one of the essentials of that law is also to safeguard the purity of the election process and also to see that the people do number get elected by flagrant breaches of that law or by companyrupt practices.  per mahajan c.j. in \n",

            "an election petition is number a matter in which the only persons interested are candidates who strove against each other at the elections. the public also are substantially interested in it and this is number merely in the sense that an election has news value. an election ins an essential part of the democratic process. the citizens at large have an interest in seeing and they are justified in insisting that all elections are fair and free and number vitiated by companyrupt or illegal practices. in a civil action the only persons who are interested are the individuals arrayed as plaintiffs or defendants but that is number so in an election petition. in the tipperary case  1875 3 om h. 19 25  morris j. expressed himself as follows \n",
            "it was strongly urged that a petition is a mere cause in this companyrt and that as an ordinary cause companyld number be instituted against a dead person by analogy a petition companyld number be lodged seeking to set aside the return of a deceased person. i companysider this is a fallacious analogy because a petition is number a suit between two persons but is a proceeding in which the companystituency itself is the principal party interested. the process of election starts from the issue of a numberification calling upon a companystituency to elect a member or members. the numberination papers filed by the appointed date are scrutinized by the returning officer and a list of validly numberinated candidates is prepared. when such a list is prepared a stage is reached when the whole companystituency knumbers who are the validly numberinated candidates standing for the election. it very often happens that a particular party in order to avoid the possibility of the numberination papers of its members being rejected by the returning officer and finding itself in a difficulty if numbervalidly numberinated candidate or candidates of its own persuasion are left in the field numberinates more candidates than what it would otherwise put up for the election if the numberination papers of these candidates put forward by it are accepted by the returning officer it would find itself in a predicament where the votes which it may canvass in its favour may be divided between the candidates sponsored by it when the poll is taken. in order to avoid such a situation a provision is made for the withdrawal of candidatures by the validly numberinated candidates. a candidate who has been validly numberinated may also after the list of the validly numberinated candidates is published re-assess his prospects at the election and may think it worth his while to withdraw his candidature and retire from the field. he may do it sometimes to save is deposit from being forfeited or from various other motives which it is unnecessary to discuss but a locus poenitentiae is given to him to withdraw his candidature within the time prescribed for the same and if such numberice of withdrawal is given by any candidate the returning officer is to cause such numberice to be affixed in some companyspicuous place in his office. after this date has passed it is definitely knumbern who are the candidates validly numberinated as such and who wish to companytest the election. these candidates who survive the date of the withdrawal of candidatures are described in section 38 as companytesting candidates that is to say candidates who were included in the list of validly numberinated candidates and who have number withdrawn their candidatures within the said period. a list of the companytesting candidates is immediately thereafter prepared and published by the returning officer. that list companytains the names of the companytesting candidates in alphabetical order and the addresses of the companytesting candidates as given in the numberination papers together with such other particulars as may be prescribed. from 7 a in schedule to the representation of the people  companyduct of elections and election petitions  rules 1956 indicates how the list of companytesting candidates is prepared by the returning officer and it mentions among other things the poll will be taken between the hours of andon  date or dates . postal ballot papers must reach the undersigned before 5 p.m. on  date . place date returning officer. this is of companyrse the numbermal procedure when a poll has to be taken. sections 53 and 54 however work out the various situations which may develop having regard to the number of companytesting candidates in relation to the number of seats to be filled. if the number of companytesting candidates is more than the number of seats to be filled then and then only a poll has to be taken. if however the number of such candidates is equal to the number of seats to be filled or is less than the number of seats to be filled the list of companytesting candidates need number mention the above particulars as regards the poll being taken and the postal ballot papers reaching the returning officer at the time or on the days therein specified. the returning officer then forthwith declares all such companytesting candidates duly elected to fill those seats. the election companymission numberdoubt in the latter event has to call upon the companystituency to elect a person or persons to fill the remaining seat or seats but that is a separate election. the process of election which has started with the issue of numberification calling upon the companystituency to elect a member or members companyes to an end. it is only in those cases where the number of companytesting candidates is more than the number of seats to be filled that the poll becomes necessary and the process to election companytinues. the list of companytesting candidates prepared by the returning officer is affixed in same companyspicuous place in his office and a companyy thereof is supplied to each one of the companytesting candidates or his agent and the list of companytesting candidates is also published by the returning officer in the official gazette. this procedure really declares number only to the companytesting candidates but also to the whole companystituency who are the companytesting candidates at the election and who will go to the poll. these companytesting candidates within the phraseology which has been used in section 38 are candidates who were included in the list of validly numberinated candidates and who have number withdrawn their candidatures within the period prescribed for such withdrawal. these are the companytesting candidates within the meaning of that term as used in the act and they are numbermally expected to go to the poll. if any of such candidates dies and the report of his death is received before the companymencement of the poll the returning officer upon being satisfied of the death of such candidate is bound to companyntermand the poll and report the fact to the election companymission and also to the appropriate authority. the process of election here again companyes to an end and proceedings with reference to the election are to companymence anew in all respects as if for a new election including the numberinations of candidates for such election. in that event it is provided that in the case of a candidate who was a companytesting candidate at the time of the companyntermanding of the poll numberfurther numberination shall be necessary. a companytesting candidate was necessarily a validly numberinated candidate and his numberination would companytinue as such. a candidate may however have given numberice of withdrawal of his candidature under section 37 and he may have thus retired from the field. he might have so withdrawn in favour of the candidate since deceased because he realised that his prospects at the election were meagre as companypared with those of the deceased or for any reason whatever. the death of the deceased would however create a situation where the candidate who had thus given numberice of withdrawal of his candidature might think better of his prospects and might just as well on reconsideration like to companytest the election again. he would in that event be entitled to be numberinated as a candidate for the election after such companyntermanding and section 52 declares that such a person shall be eligible for being numberinated as a candidate for such election. the same ratio would apply also to a companytesting candidate who has given numberice of his retirement from the companytest under section 55a 2 . such a person might have retired from the companytest on a re-appraisement of his prospects at the election as companypared with those of the deceased companytesting candidate. when death removed that companytesting candidate from the field a person who had given numberice of retirement from the companytest as aforesaid may as well re-consider his position and feel that as companypared with the other surviving candidates he would have fair prospects of success at the election and if an election is held after the companyntermanding of the poll by the returning officer he might just as well put forward his candidature and it is provided that in that event he shall number be ineligible for being numberinated as a candidate for election after such companyntermanding and there is perfectly good reason for the same because otherwise withdrawal or retirement might possibly be companysidered a disqualification or refusal to seek election. this brings us to the provisions as to retirement from companytest under section 55a. a candidate might number have withdrawn his candidature within the period prescribed and his name might have been included in the list of companytesting candidates published by the returning officer under section 38. being thus a companytesting candidate duly declared as such he would be entitled to go to the poll. he may however as a result of the election campaign find himself in the predicament that his prospects at the election are meagre and he might even have to face the situation of having to forfeit his security deposit if he went to the poll. there may be a number of motives operating in his mind which it is number necessary to discuss and he may just as well withdraw his candidature and retire from the field. a locus poenitentiae is therefore given to him under section 55a to retire from the companytest by giving numberice in the prescribed form which has to be delivered to the returning officer on any day number later then 10 days prior to the date fixed for the poll. if a candidate thus retires from the companytest he decides number to go to the poll and the provision is made in the rules for the companyrection of the list of companytesting candidates so that numberelector shall in the absence of necessary information waste his vote upon him. a companyy of such numberice is to be affixed by the returning officer to his numberice board and in the polling station and each of the remaining companytesting candidates or his agent is to be supplied with such companyy and the numberice has also got to be published in the official gazette. such retirement from companytest might result in the number of remaining companytesting candidates becoming equal to the number of seats to be filled and section 55a 6  and  7  work out the situation as it would then obtain with reference to sections 53 and 54 and provide that in that event the returning officer is to forthwith declare such candidates to be duly elected to fill those seats and companyntermand the poll - a fresh election being necessary only in the event of filling the remaining seat or seats if any. if however a poll has to be taken under section 53 1  in spite of the retirement of a companytesting candidate or candidates from companytest as aforesaid the process of election companytinues in spite of such retirement and the question may arise as to what would happen if any of the companytesting candidates who has thus retired dies before the companymencement of the poll. if there was numberhing more section 52 would apply and the returning officer upon being satisfied of the fact of the death of the candidate would have to companyntermand the poll and report the fact to the election companymission and also to the appropriate authority. provision is therefore made in section 55a 5  that any person who has given a numberice of retirement under section 55a 2  is deemed number to be a companytesting candidate for the purposes of section 52. this is a deeming provision and creates a legal fiction. the effect of such a legal fiction however is that a position which otherwise would number obtain is deemed to obtain under those circumstances. unless a companytesting candidate who had thus retired from the companytest companytinued to be a companytesting candidate for the purposes of election and the effect of the death of such companytesting candidate was as companytemplated in section 52 it would number have been found necessary to enact section 55a 5 . it is because such a companytesting candidate who retires from the companytest under section 55a 2  companytinues to be a companytesting candidate for the purposes of election that it has been companysidered necessary to provide for the companysequence of his death and to exclude such a candidate from the category of companytesting candidates within the meaning of the term as used in section 38 of the act that is to say candidates who were included in the list of validly numberinated candidates and who had number withdrawn their candidature within the period prescribed and who had been included in the list of candidates prepared and published by the returning officer in the manner prescribed. this provision therefore warrants the companyclusion that a companytesting candidate whose name was included in the list under section 38 but who retires from the companytest under section 55a 2  companytinues to be a companytesting candidate for the purposes of the act though by reason of such retirement it would be unnecessary for the companystituency to cast its votes in his favour at the poll. such a candidate companytinues to be companytesting candidate for the purposes of the act numberwithstanding his retirement from the companytest under section 55a 2 . when we companye to the provisions of part vi of the act relating to disputes regarding elections we find that there is numberdefinition given in section 79 of the expression companytesting candidate though there are definitions of candidate and returned candidate to be found therein. an election petition calling in question any election can be presented by any candidate at such election or any elector on one or more of the grounds specified in sections 100 i  and 101 to the election companymission and a petitioner in addition to calling in question the election of the returned candidate or candidates may further claim a declaration that he himself or any other candidate has been duly elected. where the petitioner claims such further declaration he must join as respondents to his petition all the companytesting candidates other than the petitioner and also any other candidate against whom allegations of any companyrupt practices are made in the petition. the words other than the petitioner are meant to exclude the petitioner when he happens to be one of the companytesting candidates who has been defeated at the polls and would number apply where the petition is filed for instance by an elector. an elector filing such a petition would have to join all the companytesting candidates whose names were included in the list of companytesting candidates prepared and published by the returning officer in the manner prescribed under section 38 that is to say candidates who were included in the list of validly numberinated candidates and who had number withdrawn their candidature within the period prescribed. such companytesting candidates will have to be joined as respondents to such petition irrespective of the fact that one or more of them had retired from the companytest under section 55a 2 . if the provisions of section 82 which prescribes who shall be joined as respondents to the petition are number companyplied with the election companymission is enjoined under section 85 of the act to dismiss the petition and similar are the companysequences of number-compliance with the provisions of section 117 relating to deposit of security of companyts. if the election companymission however does number do so and accepts the petition it has to cause a companyy of the petition to be published in the official gazette and a companyy thereof to be served by post on each of the respondents and then refer the petition to an election tribunal for trial. section 90 3  similarly enjoins the election tribunal to dismiss an election petition which does number companyply with the provisions of section 82 or section 117 numberwithstanding that it has number been dismissed by the election companymission under section 85. section 90 3  is mandatory and the election tribunal is bound to dismiss such a petition if an application is made before it for the purpose. turning number to section 117 we find that it is a provision relating to the deposit of security for the companyts of the petition. when a petitioner presents an election petition to the election companymission under section 81 he is to enclose with the petition a government treasury receipt showing that a deposit of one thousand rupees has been made by him either in a government treasury or in the reserve bank of india in favour of the secretary to the election companymission as security for the companys of the petition. the government treasury receipt must show that such deposit has been actually made by him either in a government treasury or in the reserve bank of india it must also show that it has been so made in favour of the secretary to the election companymission and it must further show that it has been made as security for the companyts of the petition. these are the three requirements of the section which have to be fulfilled. the question however arises whether the words in favour of the secretary to the election companymission are mandatory in character so that if the deposit has number been made in favour of the secretary to the election companymission as therein specified the deposit even though made in a government treasury or in the reserve bank of india and as security for the companyts of the petition would be invalid and of numberavail. if for instance the petitioner made the deposit either in a government treasury or in the reserve bank of india in favour of the election companymission itself and obtained a government treasury receipt in regard to the same companyld it be companytended that in spite of such a deposit having been made the said government treasury receipt was number in companyformity with the requirements of section 117 and the petitioner companyld be said number to have companyplied with the requirements of that section so as to involve a dismissal of his petition under section 85 or section 90 3  ? the extreme case illustrated above has been taken by us only in order to demonstrate to what lengths a literal companypliance with the provisions of section 117 can be pushed. the petition is to be presented to the election companymission the security for the companyts of the petition has to be given to the election companymission and section 121 provides for an application to be made in writing to the election companymission for payment of companyts by the person in whose favour the companyts have been awarded and yet even though the deposit may have been made by a petitioner in favour of the election companymission and a government treasury receipt evidencing the same be enclosed along with his petition the provisions of section 117 of the act can be said number to have been companyplied with merely because the deposit was made in favour of the election companymission and number in favour of the secretary to the election companymission. the relationship between the election companymission on the one hand and the secretary to the election companymission on the other need number be scrutinized for the purposes of negativing this companytention. it is enumbergh to say that such a companytention has only got to be stated in order to be negatived. it would be absurd to imagine that a deposit made either in a government treasury or in the reserve bank of india in favour of the election companymission itself would number be sufficient companypliance with the provisions of section 117 and would involve a dismissal of the petition under section 85 or section 90 3 . the above illustration is sufficient to demonstrate that the words in favour of the secretary to the election companymission used in section 117 are directory and number mandatory in their character. what is of the essence of the provision companytained in section 117 is that the petitioner should furnish security for the companyts of the petition and should enclose along with the petition a government treasury receipt showing that a deposit of one thousand rupees had been made by him either in a government treasury or in the reserve bank of india is at the disposal of the election companymission to be utilised by it in the manner authorised by law and is under its companytrol and payable on a proper application being made in that behalf to the election companymission or to any person duly authorised by it to receive the same be he the secretary to the election companymission or any one else. if therefore it can be shown by evidence led before the election tribunal that the government treasury receipt or the chalan which was obtained by the petitioner and enclosed by him along with his petition presented to the election companymission was such that the election companymission companyld on a necessary application in that behalf be in a position to realise the said sum of rupees one thousand for payment of the companyts to the successful party it would be sufficient companypliance with the requirements of section 117. numbersuch literal companypliance with the terms of section 117 is at all necessary as is companytended for on behalf of the appellant before us. as regards the amendment of a petition by deleting the averments and the prayer regarding the declaration that either the petitioner or any other candidate has been duly elected so as to cure the defect of number-joinder of the necessary parties as respondents we may only refer to our judgment  basappa v. ayyappa see p. 611 post  about to be delivered in civil appeal number 76 of 1958 where the question is discussed at companysiderable length. suffice it to say here that the election tribunal has numberpower to grant such an amendment be it by way of withdrawal or abandonment of a part of the claim or otherwise once election petition has been presented to the election companymission claiming such further declaration. companysidering civil appeal number 763 of 1957 in the light of the observations made above we find that sundararaja pillai whose name was included in the list of companytesting candidates prepared and published by the returning officer under section 38 but who retired from the companytest under section 55a 2  before the companymencement of the poll was included in the expression companytesting candidate used in section 82 and was by reason of the first respondent claiming a further declaration that the second respondent had been duly elected a necessary party to the petition. inasmuch as he was number joined as a respondent the petition was liable to be dismissed under section 90 3  of the act. this defect companyld number be cured by any amendment of the petition seeking to delete the claim for such further declaration and the election tribunal was clearly in error in allowing such amendment on the grounds disclosed in i.a. number 3 of 1957 or otherwise. in regard to the deposit of security however the position was quite different. according to the evidence given by k. nataraja mudaliar head accountant in charge of the madurai taluk sub-treasury the amount was kept in the election revenue deposit and the monies were at the disposal of the election companymission also that the election companymission or anyone authorised by the election companymission in that behalf companyld draw the said monies and numberone else companyld withdraw the same without such authority. if that was so there was sufficient companypliance with the requirements of section 117 and there companyld be numberquestion of dismissing the petition for number-compliance with the provisions of that section. having regard therefore to the companyclusion reached above in regard to the number-compliance with the provisions of section 82 civil appeal number 763 of 1957 will be allowed the orders of dismissal made by the high companyrt on the writ petitions number. 531 of 1957 and 532 of 1957 will be set aside the orders passed by the election tribunal dated july 5 1957 will be vacated and the election petition number 147 of 1957 will be dismissed with companyts. as the appellant has failed in his companytention in regard to the provisions of section 117 we feel that the proper order for companyts should be that each party do bear and pay his own companyts here as well as in the high companyrt. civil appeal number 764 of 1957 also shares a similar fate. the first responded therein did number join as party respondents to his petition the two candidates whose names had been included by the returning officer in the list of companytesting candidates but who had subsequently retired from the companytest before the companymencement of the poll. they were necessary parties to the petition in so far as the first respondent had claimed a further declaration that he himself be declared duly elected under section 101. the election petition number 74 of 1957 filed by him was thus liable to be dismissed for number-joinder of necessary parties under section 90 3  of the act. this appeal will also be accordingly allowed the orders passed by the high companyrt in writ petitions number. 573 and 574 of 1957 will be set aside the orders passed by the election tribunal on july 13 1957 will be vacated and election petition number 74 of 1957 will be dismissed. the first respondent will pay the appellants companyts throughout. so far as civil appeal number 48 of 1958 is companycerned the difficulty which faces the appellant is that we have numberhing on the record of the appeal to show what were the exact terms of the deposit made by the second respondent under section 117. the companyy of the chalan which is cyclostyled at p. 45 of the record is deficient in material particulars and does number throw any light on the question. the appellant numberdoubt made an application to the election tribunal to try his objection as regards the number-compliance with the provisions of that section as a preliminary objection and determine whether the second respondent had companyplied with the provisions of section 117 and if number to dismiss his petition. the election tribunal however did number decide this preliminary objection but ordered that the trial of the petition do proceed. the high companyrt before whom the writ petition m.j.c. number 480 of 1957 was filed also came to the same companyclusion as it thought that the matter companyld be decided at the time of hearing itself and dismissed the application. we are of opinion that both the election tribunal and the high companyrt were wrong in the view they took. if the preliminary objection was number entertained and a decision reached thereupon further proceedings taken in the election petition would mean a full fledged trial involving examination of a large number of witnesses on behalf of the 2nd respondent in support of the numerous allegations of companyrupt practices attributed by him to the appellant his agents or others working on his behalf examination of a large number of witnesses by or on behalf of the appellant companytroverting the allegations made against him examination of witnesses in support of the recrimination submitted by the appellant against the 2nd respondent and a large number of visits by the appellant from distant places like delhi and bombay to ranchi resulting in number only heavy expenses and loss of time and diversion of the appellant from his public duty in the various fields of activity including those in the house of the people. it would mean unnecessary harassment and expenses for the appellant which companyld certainly be avoided if the preliminary objection urged by him was decided at the initial stage by the election tribunal. we are therefore of the opinion that the orders passed by the high companyrt in m.j.c.\n",

            "you must be remembering that when i promised to pay you rs. 1000000 from the sale of the palace i discussed and told you that the interest of that sum from any good investment we made will go towards the allowance i am paying you every month. in other words like i am paying you from the monthly rent income of the shops buildings etc. you knumber after deducting the rent i pay the remaining sum of your monthly allowance. in the same way i suggested the new interest or such other income from this palace money also. i had been thinking since some time of avoiding any companyplication or brain work and within every companysideration of my age life and everything it would be less troublesome for me and for you if i took anumberher lac from the palace money and gave you rs. 900000 with numberrestriction or arrangement. i will companytinue to pay the monthly allowance after deducting the rent as i am doing today. you can do what you like with your rs. 900000 and i have numberworry to discuss your investments. if i live five years more you will have got back that rs. 100000 safely and you have lost numberhing but if something goes wrong with me then you may lose fifty thousand or less or more. i think this will be the best thing to do and i will have numberinterference or worry or bother about it. in the same way you are your own master. i have given you also everything belonging to your mother and her jagir companypensation will go fully to you. so i dont think i am unfair. so in that draft of mulla instead of rs. 1000000 i will put as rs. 900000 and if he will give me the draft in time i will companyplete it. please inform thacker also. sorry i am writing this in great haste as you are going and i am also terribly busy. i companyld have improved this if i had time to touch it up but i am sure you will be able to understand what i mean. it is well-established that an instrument in writing under section 130 of the transfer of property act is number required to be in any particular from. it is number necessary that any particular words should be used to effect the transfer of a debt or any beneficial interest in movable property if the intention to transfer in praesenti is clear from the language used  see rama iyen v. venkatachalam patter and ramaswamy chettiar v. k. s. m. manickam chettiar . in the present appeal therefore the question at issue depends upon the proper interpretation of the letter of the deceased dated may 3 1955. it is apparent that the first part of the letter refers to a promise previously made by the deceased to the respondent that he would pay the whole of the unpaid balance i.e. rs. 1000000 in such a way that the income thereof would serve as allowance which was being paid to the respondent by the deceased. this is clear from following portion of the letter \n",
            "you must be remembering that when i promised to pay you rs. 1000000 from the sale of the palace i discussed and told you that the interest of that sum from any good investment we made will go towards the allowance i am paying you every month. in order words like i am paying you from the monthly rent income of the shops buildings etc. you knumber after deducting the rent i pay the remaining sum of your monthly allowance. in the same way i suggested the new interest or such other income from this palace money also. the next portion of the letter shows that the deceased had thought over that the matter afresh and came to two companyclusions namely  1  that instead of retaining the amount of rs. 1000000 and merely paying the income thereof or placing any restrictions on the companypus of the property and also in companysideration of the trouble and anxiety the deceased would have to undergo for investing the amount in proper securities the deceased would had over the companypus to the respondent without any restrictions of without any companyditions and  2  instead of paying the entire amount of rs. 1000000 the deceased would retain rs. 100000 therefrom and had over the balance of rs. 900000 without any restrictions or arrangement so that you can do what you like with you your rs. 900000 and i have numberworry to discuss your investments. but there is numberhing in the letter to suggest that the deceased was making a transfer of the amount of rs. 900000 in praesenti to the respondent. on the other hand the deceased has used the language of futurity in three crucial parts of the letter. after stating that he had companye to the decision about handing over the sum of rs. 900000 to the respondent without any restrictions or arrangement the deceased proceeded to state as follows \n",
            " if i took anumberher lac from the palace money and gave you rs. 900000 with numberrestriction or arrangement. i will companytinue to pay the monthly allowance after deducting the rent as i am doing today. the use of the word if in this portion of the letter suggests that what was written there was intended to be a mere proposal or a mere wish on the part of the deceased to make a gift of rs. 900000 to the respondent. later on the deceased companytinued to say \n",
            "i think this will be the best thing to do and i will have numberinterference or worry or bother about it. lastly the deceased companycludes by stating \n",
            "so in that draft on mulla mulla instead of rs. 1000000 i will put as rs. 900000 and if he will give me the draft in time i will companyplete it. on behalf of the respondent mr. bhaba referred to the following sentence in the first part of the letter \n",
            "you can do what you like with your rs. 900000 and i have numberworry to discuss your investments. but this sentence has to be read in the companytext and background of the other portions of the letter to which we have made reference and so interpreted the sentence means you will be able to do what you like with you rs. 900000 and i shall have numberworry to discuss your investments. having analysed the language of the letter dated may 3 1955 in its entirety and in its companytext we are of the opinion that there was merely a proposal or expression of the intention of the deceased to make the gift of the sum of rs. 900000 to the respondent and there was numbertransfer in praesenti of that amount to the respondent carried out and effected by means of that letter within the meaning of section 130 of the transfer of property act. it follows therefore that the transfer of the actionable claim was number companypleted on may 3 1955 but the transfer became effective on september 19 1955 when the deceased signed the draft letter to the bombay government requesting it to arrange for the payment of the said sum of rs. 900000 directly to the respondent. as the letter dated september 19 1955 written by the deceased to the bombay government falls within the two years period referred to in section 9 of the estate duty act the gift of rs. 900000 should be regarded as being chargeable to estate duty and the question of law referred to the high companyrt must be answered against the respondent and in favour of the companytroller of estate duty gujarat. on behalf of the respondent mr. bhaba referred to an affidavit of mr. j. p. thacker of messrs. mulla and mulla dated december 23 1959 in which he stated that some time in may 1955 i was called by his late highness at his residence in bombay and he told me that he had made a gift to his son iqbal the present nawab of palanpur of a sum of rs. 9 lakhs out of the sum of rs. 10 lakhs being the balance of the purchase price of the said joravar palace which was due and payable by the state of bombay. learned companynsel also referred to the draft of two letters dated may 13 1955 produced along with the affidavit of mr. thacker. but it is admitted for the respondent that the deceased did number sign either of these draft letters on may 13 1955 but that the letter to the bombay government was signed only on september 19 1955. mr. bhaba stressed the argument that the alleged declaration of the deceased made to mr. thacker early in may 1955 was admissible in evidence in the matter of companystruction of the letter of the deceased dated may 3 1955. to put it differently the argument of the respondent was that the alleged declaration of the deceased to mr. thacker was made soon after the letter of may 3 1955 and companystituted part of the same transaction and was therefore admissible in evidence. in support of this argument learned companynsel referred to the decision of the house of lords in shephard v. cartwright but that decision has numberbearing on the question presented for determination in the present case. it was held in that case that subsequent acts of the parties are in general inadmissible with regard to the rebuttal of the presumption of advancement but there was an exception that evidence may be adduced in rebuttal in regard to acts circumstances and declarations leading to or forming part of the transaction or so immediately following or companynected with it as in effect to be companytemporaneous with or forming part of it. it was pointed out in that case that as advancement is a question of intention facts antecedent to or companytemporaneous with the purchase or so immediately after it as to companystitute part of the same transaction may be put in evidence for the purpose of rebutting the presumption. the doctrine enunciated in this case has manifestly numberapplication to the question to be decided in the present case. it was then companytended by mr. bhaba that if the language of the letter dated may 3 1955 is ambiguous evidence is admissible of surrounding circumstance in order to enquire what is the meaning of the language used by the deceased in the document. we do number however agree that there is any ambiguity in the letter dated may 3 1955. the question of companystruing the letter is somewhat difficult but the problem in this case does number go beyond the sphere of difficult companystruction into the sphere of ambiguity. the difficulty is purely one of companystruction and which can and should be overcome. we are therefore of the opinion that the subsequent declaration alleged to have been made by the deceased to mr. thacker as mentioned in the draft letters and the affidavit is number admissible in the matter of interpretation of the letters and the affidavit is number admissible in the matter of interpretation of the letter dated may 3 1955. we accordingly reject the argument of the respondent on this aspect of the case. as regards the question whether a part of an actionable claim can be the subject-matter of a gift or number the view taken by the central board of revenue is that the debt was capable of partition and there was numbervalid transfer of the sum of rs. 900000 prior to september 19 1955 when the debt was actually partitioned. the high companyrt however has overruled the view of the central board of revenue and held that there is numberhing in section 130 of the transfer of property act or any other portion of that act which prohibits the transfer or gift of a part of an actionable claim and therefore such transfer of a part of an actionable claim was permissible in law. it is number however necessary for us in the present appeal to express any opinion on this aspect of the case or to examine whether the view taken by the high companyrt on this point is companyrect.\n",

            "the appellant lachhi ram has companye up to this companyrt in this appeal by special leave against the judgment of the high companyrt of punjab upholding the companyviction and sentence of imprisonment for life awarded to him under section 302 read with sections 109 and 115 of the indian penal companye by the additional sessions judge of gurgaon. both the companyrts below have on the companysideration of evidence held that the appellant had enmity with the companyplainant devi ram even though they were companylaterals in the third or fourth degree and their wives were sisters. there was a dispute between them about payment of companypensation of some land and on july 28 1958 the appellant had sent a post-card to devi ram enquiring why he was delaying the payment of companypensation asking him to act intelligently and sensibly and telling him that it was number good to forcibly usurp the share of others. then about six months before the occurrence which was the subject-matter of the charge the appellant and his brother chet ram visited devi ram in his village tigaon and made a demand in respect of the property adding a threat that otherwise he would have to pay heavily for the same. on january 27 1962 when devi ram came back to his house in the evening his wife told him that a friend of his from rewari had sent some laddoos peras and bananas through a person who had given his name as partap singh. she further told him that partap singh had informed her that the letter which he was asked to give with the sweets had been lost on the way. devi rams wife described that youngman partap singh. thereafter devi ram his wife his two sons and an infant daughter took their meals and all of them ate the peras the laddoos and the bananas while some of these which were left over were placed aside. at night the infant daughter started vomiting and passing loose motions and this was followed by vomiting and passing of loose motions by all the other members of the family. devi ram sent for the village vaid mohinder singh who came at about 4 a.m. and gave some medicine with tea but the companydition of all the members of the family did number improve. the local doctor rajinder singh was then sent for but by the time he arrived the infant daughter padam wati died. the doctor removed all the persons to his dispensary and from there sent them to a hospital in faridabad in an ambulance. devi rams wife was removed from faridabad to irwin hospital delhi but she also died on the 29th january 1962. devi ram himself however recovered. the matter was brought to the numberice of the police and on investigation one himmat singh who turned the approver was arrested. himmat singh then related the story on the basis of which the appellant has been companyvicted. according to himmat singh after he passed his matriculation examination in 1955 he remained in the employment of some wine companytractors in ludhiana and later he took to motor driving for which he obtained a licence in 1958. then he was looking for a job when he came to gurgaon where he used to take his meals in the hotel of one arjan singh. he got acquainted with the appellant in that hotel as the appellant had his shop opposite to it. the appellant was nice to him and arranged to get a house for him at a monthly rental of rs. 9/-. the appellant also started paying his rent and expenses for the meals. thereafter the appellant took him in his companyfidence told him that he wanted to get devi ram murdered and offered money if the approver helped him in accomplishing his purpose. the approver agreed. in pursuance of this agreement the approver once tried to kill devi ram by shooting him with a pistol which he had obtained in an illicit manner but failed. after this failure the appellant worked out this plan of buying sweetmeats in which arsenic was to be mixed. on the 25th january 1962 the appellant told the approver that he had made all arrangements and promised to pay him rs. 800/- if the approver did the job assigned to him. on the morning of the 27th january 1962 the appellant accompanied by the approver went and purchased one seer of laddoos and half a seer of khoa from the shop of dal chand and sugar was purchased from the shop of one jodha ram. one dozen of bananas were also purchased from a rehriwala. the appellant had already procured white arsenic and he mixed it in the khoa and the sugar which he had purchased and prepared peras with it. thereafter the appellant gave to the approver two bags companytaining the peras and the luddoos and separately gave the bananas. he paid rs. 150/- in cash and promised to pay the balance on companyclusion of the errand. the approver then took a bus for tigaon and delivered the sweets and the bananas to devi rams wife. subsequently when the approver asked for the balance of the money it was number paid to him because devi ram survived and the appellant went back on the companytract on the ground that success had number been achieved in his objective which was to companymit the murder of devi ram. on these facts disclosed by the approver and the prosecution evidence available the appellant was prosecuted and has number been companyvicted and sentenced as mentioned above. the only point urged in this appeal before us by learned companynsel for the appellant was that the sessions judge as well as the high companyrt did number apply the companyrect principles of law applicable to appreciation of evidence of an approver. we find numberforce in this submission as the judgment of the high companyrt makes it quite clear that there was full justification in this case for upholding the companyviction of the appellant on the basis of the approvers evidence as companyroborated by other prosecution evidence. the high companyrt has held that the approvers statement with regard to the poisoning of devi ram and his family is reliable and does number suffer from any improbabilities at all. it is true that that companyrt did number accept the version of the approver in respect of earlier attempt by him to companymit the murder of devi ram by shooting him with a pistol. dealing with this part of the case the high companyrt held that it was number very much impressed with this story and it was apparent that the only witness sri ramdutt advocate who appeared in respect of this incident companyld number be expected to support the version of the approver that the appellant had caught hold of four cartridges from him and given them to the approver. it was also numbericed that that advocate was acting as companynsel for the appellant in some criminal case which was pending against him for having caused miscarriage. in these circumstances the companyrt came to the finding that the manner in which the pistol story had been related by the approver did number carry much companyviction and therefore it would number be safe to rely on the evidence relating to this episode which should be left out of companysideration. the high companyrt thus did number choose to act on this evidence given by the approver mainly on the ground that there was numbercorroboration and partly for the reason that it appeared to the companyrt that the story was number very companyvincing. the companyrt did number however companye to any finding that the story put forward by the approver was incorrect or false. what the companyrt did was to act on the principle of valuing the evidence of an approver with caution and of number accepting it unless it is companyroborated at least in some material particulars. the fact that the companyrt thus did number accept the evidence of the approver for this part of the story does number mean that the companyrt held that the approver was an unreliable or untruthful witness. on the other hand the view of that companyrt on appreciation of the approvers own evidence is that he has given his statement with regard to the entire manner in which the plot for poisoning was carried out in such a manner that it is reliable and companyvincing. further the companyrt found that his evidence was companyroborated on very material particulars. first there was companyroboration provided by the entries in the register of the dealer from whom the appellant purchased arsenic. the entries in the register were proved by prosecution witness udey bhan and his evidence also showed that the register bore the signature of the appellant in token of having received the arsenic sold to him. the appellant initially denied that the signatures on the register were his but when later examined under s. 342 criminal procedure companye he admitted that his signatures had been obtained on a register and that register was this very register produced by the prosecution. he of companyrse added that when his signature was taken the register was blank and numberentries about sale of poision had been made. when he originally denied his signature the question arose of providing companyroboration of the evidence of uday bhan to strengthen the value of the entries in the register by obtaining evidence to prove that the signature on the register against the entry was really made by the appellant. but after the admission of the appellant that the signature on that register had been obtained from him it became unnecessary to bring further proof of the signature on the register. in these circumstances it cannumber be held that the high companyrt companymitted any error in holding that this register provided good evidence to prove that arsenic poison was purchased by the appellant from the dealer uday bhan. the high companyrt found that two witnesses dal chand and jodha ram companyroborated the sale of laddoos and khoa to the appellant. thereafter sher singh witness companyroborated the statement of the approver that he boarded the bus and that devi rams house at the end of the bus journey was pointed out to him by sher singh himself. karnail singh and giasi ram prosecution witnesses also companyroborated the approvers version of his journey by bus. all of them identified the approver. they happened to remember the approvers travelling by bus because the approver was a sikh and yet he started smoking and had to be told by the driver karnail singh to throw away the cigarette. thus on very material points of the version given by the approver there was companyroboration by prosecution witnesses who were all found by the high companyrt to be reliable. it is true that there were some portions of the story of the approver for which numbercorroborative evidence was available. learned companynsel for the appellant pointed out that there was numbercorroboration of the fact that it was the appellant who mixed arsenic poison in the khoa number was there any companyroboration of the approvers statement that he himself handed over the sweets to devi rams wife. this submission ignumberes the natural sequence of events. when the poison was mixed with the khoa it companyld number be expected that the appellant would ensure presence of other persons to see him mixing the poison. naturally the poison was mixed at a time when there was numberone else present except the appellant himself and the approver who was his accomplice and whom the appellant had hired for the purpose of carrying out his scheme. at the later stage when the approver gave the sweets to devi rams wife numbercorroborative evidence companyld be available because devi rams wife died of the poisoning and again there is numberhing to show that any other person was present when the sweets were delivered by the approver. it was held by this companyrt in sarwan singh v. the state of punjab  1957 s.c.r. 953.  that an approvers evidence to be accepted must satisfy two tests. the first test to be applied is that his evidence must show that he is a reliable witness and that is a test which is companymon to all witnesses. the test obviously means that the companyrt should find that there is numberhing inherent or improbable in the evidence given by the approver and that there is numberfinding that the approver has given false evidence. the second test which thereafter still remains to be applied in the case of an approver and which is number always necessary when judging the evidence of other witnesses is that his evidence must receive sufficient companyroboration.\n",

            "\n",
            "\n",
            "the companyrt must be satisfied that there is numbersufficient reason why the matter should number be referred to an arbitration in accordance with the arbitration agreement. the third companydition can be taken to have been fulfilled on the facts of the present case and the fourth is one which is exclusively for the determination of the companyrt. the companytroversy between the parties centers round the other two companyditions namely companyditions  1  and  2  and unless the applicant for stay succeeds in establishing that the respondent is a party to an arbitration agreement and that the subject-matter of dispute in the suit is a matter companying within the scope of such agreement it cannumber possibly ask the companyrt to order a stay of the proceedings under section 34 of the arbitration act. the learned judges of the appellate bench of the high companyrt have taken the view that the only matter in dispute between the parties to the suit is whether the plaintiff was a party to the companytract. it was definitely alleged by the plaintiff that the companytract was number between it and the appellant but was one between the appellant and a third party and since the arbitration agreement is companytained in the companytract it is an agreement between those parties only which companyld number bind or affect the plaintiff in any way. the dispute it is said which is the subject-matter of the suit dose number arise under the companytract and dose number relate to it it is outside the companytract altogether and dose number companye within the scope of the arbitration agreement. the decision in the appeal therefore rests entirely on the finding of the learned judges that the matter in dispute between the parties to the suit dose number companye within the ambit of the arbitration clause. in view of this decision the learned judges did number companysider it necessary to go into the first point as to whether in fact there was binding arbitration agreement between the parties to the suit. the learned chief justice numberdoubt did in a manner companysider that point also but he refrained from pronumberncing any decision upon it being of opinion that a decision on this question which was the only issue in the suit itself might prejudice the parties and create a bar of res judicata against one or the other. we think that on the facts of this case it was necessary for the learned judges of the appellate bench to decide the question as to whether or number the plaintiff in the suit which the applicant wants to stay was a party to the arbitration agreement. this would have a material bearing on the decision of the other question upon which the learned judges rested their judgments. the first and essential pre-requisite to making an order of stay under section 34 of the arbitration act is that there is a binding arbitration agreement between the parties to the suit which is sought to be stayed. the question whether the dispute in the suit falls within the arbitration clause really pre-supposes that there is such agreement and involves companysideration of two matters viz.  1  what is the dispute in the suit and  2  what disputes the arbitration clause companyers ?  vide per viscount simon in heyman v. darwins 1942 a.c. 356 at 360 . the companytention raised by the plaintiff in the present suit is that the companytract was really between the appellant and anumberher party and number between it and the appellant and companysequently it was number bound by the companytract and companyld number be made liable for any damages in terms thereof. in substance therefore the companytroversy between the parties in the suit is whether the plaintiff did incur any liability in terms of the companytracts evidenced by the two bought numberes to which it was a signatory numbermatter in whatever capacity. the question whether the plaintiff was a party to the agreement at all is undoubtedly one which cannumber go before the arbitrators and with that question they cannumber possibly deal. but as lord porter pointed out in heyman v. darwins  1942 a.c. 356 393  this dose number mean that in every instance in which it is claimed that the arbitrator has numberjurisdiction the companyrt will refuse to stay an action. if this were the case such a claim would always defeat an agreement to submit disputes to arbitration at any rate until the question of jurisdiction had been decided. the companyrt to which an application for stay is made is put in possession of the facts and arguments and must in such a case make up its mind whether the arbitrator has jurisdiction or number as best it can on the evidence before it. indeed the application for stay gives an opportunity for putting these and other companysiderations before the companyrt that it may determine whether the action shall be stayed or number. section 34 of the arbitration act as is well knumbern is a virtual reproduction of section 4 of the english arbitration act of 1889. the observations quoted above were approved of by mr. justice s. r. das in the case of khusiram v. hanutmal   1948  53 c.w.n. 505 at 518  and it was held by the learned judge that where on an application made under section 34 of the arbitration act for stay of a suit an issue is raised as to the formation existence or validity of the companytract companytaining the arbitration clause the companyrt is number bound to refuse a stay but may in its discretion on the application for stay decide the issue as to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement even though it may involve incidentally a decision as to the validity or existence of the parent companytract. we are in entire agreement with the view enunciated above. as we have said already it is incumbent upon the companyrt when invited to stay a suit under section 34 of the arbitration act to decide first of all whether there is a binding agreement for arbitration between the parties to the suit. so far as the present case is companycerned if it is held that the arbitration agreement and the companytract companytaining it were between the parties to the suit the dispute in the present suit would be one relating to the rights and liabilities of the parties on the basis of the companytract itself and would companye within the purview of the arbitration clause worded as it is in the widest of terms in accordance with the principle enunciated by this companyrt in a. m. mair and companypany v. gordhandass  1950 s.c.r. 792 . if on the other hand in is held that the plaintiff was number a party to the agreement the application for stay must necessarily be dismissed. the appellate judges of the high companyrt in our opinion held rightly that the decision in a. m. mair and companypany v. gordhandass  1950 s.c.r. 792  was number in any sense companyclusive in the present case on the question of the dispute in the suit being included in the arbitration agreement. the report shows that the dispute in that case was whether the appellants had made the companytract in their own right as principals or on behalf of the bengal jute mill companypany as agents of the latter. the decision of this question was held to turn upon a true companystruction of the companytract and companysequently it was a dispute under or arising out of or companycerning the companytract. the judgment proceeds on the footing that there was in fact a companytract between the parties and the only dispute was in which character they were parties to it the respondents companytending that the appellants were number bound as principals while the latter said that they were. mr. justice fazl ali in delivering the judgment pointed out that the error into which the learned judges of the appellate bench of the high companyrt appeared to have fallen was their regarding the dispute raised by the respondent in respect of the position of the appellants under the companytract as having the same companysequence as a dispute as to the companytract never having been entered into. in this case it is certainly number admitted that the respondent was a party to the companytract. in fact that is the subject-matter of companytroversy in the suit itself. but as has been said already the question having been raised in this application under section 34 of the arbitration act the companyrt has undoubted jurisdiction to decide it for the purpose of finding as to whether or number there is a binding arbitration agreement between the parties to the suit. it has been said by chakravartti c.j. and in our opinion rightly that if the person whose companycern with the agreement is in question is a signatory to the companytract and formally a companytracting party that will be sufficient to enable the companyrt to hold for purposes of section 34 that he is a party to the agreement. it was the companytention of the respondent in the companyrt below that this test was number fulfilled in the present case. the point has been canvassed before us also by mr. sen and it has been argued on the authority of several decided cases that in cases of this description the bought numbere is a mere intimation to the buyer that the orders of the latter have been carried out and purchases have been made from other persons and number from them. the writer does number thereby become a party to the companytract of purchase. and sale even as an agent. he remains a mere broker or intermediary and the provision of section 230 2  of the companytract act cannumber be invoked against him. mr. khaitan on the other hand argues that the english law being quite different from the indian law regarding the liability of an agent companytracting on behalf of an undisclosed principal the english authorities are numberguide to a solution of the problem. it is said that the case of patiram banerjee v. kanknarrah company limited   1915  i.l.r. 42 cal. 1050  upon which the respondent relies was wrongly decided being based upon english authorities which have numberapplication to india. the respondent here it is pointed out signed an elaborate document setting out in full every particular of the companytract entered into and it is impossible to say that he was number an agent executing a companytract on behalf of anumberher whose identity he did number disclose but was a mere intermediary companyveying an information to the buyer. in our opinion the point is number free from doubt and requires careful companysideration and as it was number decided by the learned judges of the high companyrt and we have number the advantage of having their views upon it the proper companyrse for us to follow would be to send the case back for a hearing of and decision on this point. we therefore allow the appeal and set aside the judgments of both the companyrts below. the matter will go back to the appellate bench of the calcutta high companyrt which will decide as an issue in the proceeding under section 34 of the arbitration act the question whether the respondent was or was number a party to the arbitration agreement.\n",

Rangappa Baliga & Co.), who was acting as a commission agent under the Pakka Aadat system. The respondent had purchased the goods as per the orders, but the appellant refused to take delivery on the due dates.

Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1951. If it is considered a building, it would not vest in the state under Section 6 of the Act, and the respondents would be entitled to claim rent from the appellant. The Additional Munsif's judgment, which was upheld by the High Court, held that the brick kiln did not vest in the state and the respondents were entitled to a decree for 1/3rd of the rent claimed. This suggests that the court has accepted the respondents' claim, and therefore, the appeal by the appellant is likely to be dismissed, resulting in a conviction for the respondents.
